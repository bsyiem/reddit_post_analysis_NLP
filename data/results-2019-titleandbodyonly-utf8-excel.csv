"Huge stall 3+ weeks at 7 months out, need encouragement/advice","So I document my intake daily, I stay between 800-1000 calories a day. I'm getting about 65g of protein a day and at least 60oz of fluids. I exercise at least 3 times a week doing mostly cardio. I swim at least 3 times a week too. I lost about 4 lbs in the past month but at my last weight-in, I actually gained 5lbs. Feeling discouraged as if my weight loss has stopped or plateaued.

I no longer enjoy cooking,"Ever since getting sleeved a year ago, all joy of cooking has gone. Has anyone gone through this? How did you get back into it? All I do is eat my small basic meal, and do as little work as possible to get it ready."
Two-ville!!!!,"OMG, please, I just need to get this out because I'm so excited after a rough post-op start.  I officially weigh under 300lbs!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (and more exclamation marks!) My weight hasn't started with a 2 in freaking YEARS!  My highest weight was 374 ffs, there was a point I thought I would hit 400, now I'm 298.4!!! 

I got myself down to 321lbs the day of my surgery (December 10, 2018) And now I'm down over 20lbs since then. Holy crap... like, really?!? I freaking love planning out my meals and my new style of eating. I've gotten advice and encouragement here and I want to thank you all so much. You guys, a two!!!!!! &lt;3 "
Don't have anyone to drive me. Any reason I can't drive myself to/from?,"I'm scheduled for two night stay. It's 3 1/2 hour drive each way. Of course the hospital forbids me to drive upon discharge, but I don't have a choice. I'll be clear-headed, right? "
Protein shakes,Lol this is just a rant but after nearly of month of these nasty things its hard for me to believe that there are people in this world that drink them voluntarily.
Skinny = Better Treatment,"Everyone I know personally that has gone through a wls had noted that they are treated substantially better now they are thinner.

The most obvious reason for this is because we're more asthetically pleasing, triggering people to treat us better, both consciously and subconsciously (implying people are highly judgmental and use that judgement against people who are fat). 

In an unrelated sub it was brought up that another possible factor is that we feel better about ourselves (implying we are judgemental of ourselves) as well as just feel better in general (feeling of health), and therefore project a more positive attitude to which other people will gravitate. 

What are your experiences and thoughts on this? "
Am I the slowest loser in the world post-op?,"Hi guys!

I had the gastric bypass on the 4th of this month, and have been recovering really well.  Iâ€™m over the liquids stage and in the purÃ©e phase now, however, my weight loss is on par with someone who couldâ€™ve lost weight without the surgery!

Since the surgery, Iâ€™ve only lost 5kg (11 pounds) and now incorporate daily walks as my exercise. And whilst I have ZERO regrets about the surgery and am truly thrilled with my healing, I was told by one of the surgeons that I was definitely one of the slower â€œlosersâ€.

I donâ€™t want to be disheartened, but Iâ€™m concerned because I realise this tool is at its best in the early stages and starting at 150kg (331 pounds approx) and being 5â€™5 I have significant amount of weight to push.

In case itâ€™s relevant, I eat homemade soups made from scratch with a variety of veg and alternating spices (also 2/3 protein shakes).I have yet to try chicken and fish but will do soon since Iâ€™m cleared for them. I start the soft food stage in 2 weeks time and Iâ€™m really worried that eating as little as my pouch can stand as it is isnâ€™t leading to any major loss.

On the plus side,  I can feel my physical health improve drastically and Iâ€™m so grateful for that and even some of my  clothes are looser now. 

But I canâ€™t help it...Iâ€™m a numbers girl and Iâ€™m so worried I wonâ€™t reach even the expected weight loss stats for someone whoâ€™s had the gastric bypass in the next 6-12 months.

I really donâ€™t want this to fail, especially since Iâ€™ve wanted this for SO long!"
A Message to the Haters,"\*Edit:  This is a reaction post after googling ""weight loss surgery subreddits"" this morning and seeing all kinds of negativity.  It has nothing to do with you wonderful people here, sorry for any misunderstanding.

A Message to the Haters

My name is Ryan, and Iâ€™m obese. I know exactly what you think of me. I feel the judgement every time Iâ€™m out in public. Virtually every aspect of my life is affected by my weight. I avoid mirrors, especially when Iâ€™m naked. I donâ€™t mind selfies, but when Iâ€™m with a group of people and someone starts taking pictures, my brain starts to go into panic-mode.

I turn 35 next month and Iâ€™m 290 pounds at a height of 5â€™8. Iâ€™ve been in the upper 200s for 95% of my adult life, and 300 pounds at my heaviest. I started the six-month long preparation process for getting bariatric surgery recently. One of the questions I had to answer was how many times I went on a diet in my life.  My answer?  &gt;100

When people see a guy my size, many if not most see weakness. They see someone with no self-control. Let me tell you about what they donâ€™t see. They donâ€™t see my bipolar disorder. They donâ€™t see the 11 years Iâ€™ve been on antipsychotic medication, something they literally give people who are dying from lack of appetite and canâ€™t find a way to get the calories they need. Let me reiterate; Iâ€™m on a class drug they give you so you can gain weight, and I will most likely never be able to get by without that class of drug.

I could write multiple books about the trials and tribulations I go through in an average month thanks to my mental illness. Iâ€™m not complaining about being dealt a bad hand, Iâ€™m making the most of it. I go to my appointments, I take my medication every single day. I donâ€™t feel sorry for myself. Iâ€™m currently in my junior year of college and made the Deanâ€™s List my last semester, which was my first semester of college in over a decade. Iâ€™m the most optimistic person I know, and I have lost friends because I was too positive and never succumb to the darkness inside my brain.

Iâ€™m smart enough to know what people think about bariatric surgery patients, that weâ€™re cheating, that weâ€™re so weak weâ€™ll literally risk our lives instead of overcoming our issues and putting in the hard work necessary to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Iâ€™ll be the first to admit I get discouraged by my lack of long-term success. My weight is constantly in flux, and my weight is an absolute obsession. I lost 48 pounds back in 2017, with half of that coming in the last 3 months of the year. I gained almost all of it back in 2018. So now that weâ€™ve established where Iâ€™m at, letâ€™s talk about you, the hater.

You are making judgements about a situation youâ€™ve never been in. You literally have no idea what youâ€™re talking about. You havenâ€™t read the science behind long-term success with weight loss. Think about the people in your life whoâ€™ve lost weight. Did they keep that weight off their entire lives, or did they go back to their heaviest weight? Sure, there are success stories, but there are few and far between. If you actually read the recent scientific studies about obesity, you would understand that your body will terrorize and bully you to get back to your heaviest weight. My body will be pissed off at me unless Iâ€™m eating the number of calories it takes to sustain myself at my highest weight of 300 pounds.

I was 265 pounds before I was legally an adult. Before my government trusted my judgement enough to cast a single vote, my BMI was over 40 and I was considered morbidly obese. When I started my adult life, I already had doomed myself to an existence where my body would want an obscene amount of food each day. Add on the aforementioned mental illness and medication for that illness, and I have reached the point where I realize this is the only thing that will work for me long-term. Do I wish I could keep the weight off without surgery? Absolutely. But I know myself well enough to know this surgery is the only way Iâ€™ll ever keep the weight off.

Perhaps you still think Iâ€™m weak, and if youâ€™re that judgmental, Iâ€™m glad I know it upfront.  If you're still here, Iâ€™m about to defend myself even further, not for my sake, but for the sake of others in similar situations. I had a doctor prescribe me 6mg of Xanax a day for over a year. For those of you reading this who donâ€™t know, thatâ€™s easily 3 times the amount it would be remotely safe to give any patient for their anxiety. I had no idea it was an abnormal amount, so I became horribly dependent on an incredibly addictive drug through no fault of my own, as I literally never took more than the prescribed amount. Do you want to know how many mg of Xanax I have taken in the last \~8 years combined? \~40mg, always in small doses.

Oh, and there was the drinking.  At its worst, I was drinking just under a liter of rum each day for 4 months straight. Do you want to know how many servings of alcohol Iâ€™ve had in the last \~8 years? At the most, a dozen, never more than 2 in a day. Call me weak all you want, but thereâ€™s a damn good chance you wouldnâ€™t have the strength to overcome those addictions, at least not to the degree I have.

So here we are. You probably havenâ€™t changed your mind, but no matter how perfect you think you are, you have shortcomings too. And there are people who judge you for your shortcomings, whether you know it or not. Iâ€™m doing something good for my health, both physical and mental. I donâ€™t care that you think Iâ€™m cheating. Iâ€™m doing the only thing that will give me the ammunition it will take for me to win this war. Unless youâ€™ve lived the same life I have, but with better results in regards to permanent weight loss, your opinion means absolutely nothing."
How long after surgery for first bowl movement?,"Hi, my husband keeps feeling the urge to poop but nothing so far. How long is expected for the first bowl movement? He's day 2 post-op and back at home. He had the laproscopic VSG surgery.


I'm hesitant to give him miralax even though he asked me about it because we're behind water goals for the day. What do you all think?

Edit: I called the surgical nurse team and one nurse told me to mix miralax with 12 oz of fluid and give to him now to sip on then call the doctor's office in the morning if still no BM.

Edit: It wasn't a poop, it was gas and his stomach was cramping from the gas he absorbed into his GI tract from the surgery a few days later.
 So the gas pain originally in his shoulder moved to his GI tract. By day three post-op we took chewable gasx and chewed it like 40 times then swallowed and felt sooooo much better was able to fart it was incredible! 

We also did the miralax. Hoping for a smooth bowel movement.

Edit: My husband pooped post-op day 6 (exactly 7 days from the time he went into surgery) it was big and soft thanks to the Miralax, thank you!!! Lol sorry for TMI"
Do you guys see your weight loss when you look in the mirror?,"Hi all! I had my surgery 1/16/19 and have since lost 56 pounds. Everyone I know has been complimenting me and telling how different I look, but I donâ€™t see it. When I look in the mirror, I still see the same old me, from 56 pounds ago. I sort of expected this in the beginning, but Iâ€™m wondering if it gets better? Will I eventually see myself as I currently am? Thanks in advance for your input!"
Stress eating,"I know one of my biggest issues with food is that I stress eat and because of my issues with anxiety and OCD (actually diagnosed, not just something I made up), I get stressed pretty easily. Fellow stress-eaters, what have you done post-op instead of eating?"
What was your surgery intake like?,"You enter the hospital for your surgery, then what happened?"
Sleeved 06/05/2019,"Any surgery buddies wanna connect? Anything around this date is preferred, that way we can grow and heal together physically and emotionally. I have support in my home but Iâ€™d like to have someone to connect with that is experiencing this in real time with me."
Surgery day. Wish me luck guys!,"Im getting VSG surgery today with a gallbladder removal as well. Im 235 pounds down, 175 to go. I cant wait to start this new journey, and hopefully with much less pain than I am currently in. Thank you everyone here for all of your encouragement. I wouldnt have gone through it without yalls support.

Quitting diet soda,"How important is it to quit diet soda? I am pretty addicted to the stuff. I pretty much live on diet mountain dew and diet pepsi. Its kinda the one thing I have left that I havent given up. 

 I am probably having surgery in the next 2 months. Just got cleared psychologically last week. My WLS is getting closer and closer and I am just wondering hpw important it is for me to quit soda. What have your guys' experiences been?

Thanks."
Today is my 1 year surgiversary! I am 100lbs down and would love to answer any questions from people considering VSG or WLS,"Here is my comparison from the morning of my surgery (3/1/2018) to this morning (3/1/2019). 

&amp;#x200B;

My highest weight was around 315lbs--I was terrified of looking at the scale at that time so I'm not 100% sure.

The day of my 2-week pre-op diet I was 261lbs

Surgery weight was 250lbs.

Today I am 161lbs! I am no longer pre-hypertensive or pre-diabetic. My blood pressure is in the healthy normal range and my sugar has gone down significantly and returned to normal. 6 months after surgery I started eating ovo-vegetarian. As of today I am 100% plant based/vegan.

Sleeve vs RNY?,"I am a female, mid-twenties, BMI 41.2. I recently had a meeting with a surgeon and I am a bit confused. I went in thinking I would get the sleeve and most of my research had been about it, but the surgeon recommended RNY. He cited weight regain and social life aspects. With the RNY, he said you can return to a regular social life faster and after a year, you would be able to eat normally enough that no one can tell you have gotten surgery. With the sleeve, he says it will be a restriction for the rest of my life. He does a lot of revision surgeries from sleeve to RNY also and he said a lot of people with sleeve have significant regain. I am also worried about GERD with sleeve.

I am really confused now because RNY was something I never imagined myself getting. I keep reading about long term vitamin deficiencies, but my surgeon was adamant that there will be no issue. He says he recommends vitamins for 3 months, then afterwards you should be able to get them all from foods. Any deficiency later could be supplemented. He didn't seem so worried about it and said that 99% of vitamin absorption happens in the large intestine anyway and they bypass a very small amount of the small intestine with RNY. He said if his family member would be asking which surgery to get, he would never recommend the sleeve.

What has been your experience with both the sleeve and RNY? What are long-term complications you have seen? How was pregnancy afterward? Weight regain? 

Thank you very much in advance for your help!"
What was your avg weekly weight loss at 5 months postop sleeve,"After 5 months how much is your weekly average loss. Dr has me on keto now. And since Feb 8 I've only lost about 25lbs. I did what I was told by others in not tracking for a day then getting back to it. Scale is holding steady at 254 now. Hw 343, sw 325, 3 months 279. I'm still doing a  strict diet. 70% fat, 25% protein, 5% carbs on a 900 cal day diet. Which means 70g fat 58g protein 11g total carbs. These were doctor orders. I'm impatient but at this stage I wonder if I'm doing something wrong. Yes I get loads of fluids. Any suggestions?"
Comorbidities- do you have to be visiting the doctor regularly for these to apply for the wls or can it just be documented in your semi-recent past?,I had visit 3 out of 4 today with my nutritionist and ended up a little discouraged. I have been doing very well on the pre-op diet and have lost 25lbs. This brings my BMI down to 40.5. My nutritionist starting asking me if I have any comorbidities to still be qualified for the surgery. I was surprised since I thought it was determined by your starting weight and the diet was to show your investment in changing your lifestyle. I have GERD and sleep apnea but I have not been seen by a doctor for quite a while. I hoping this will not delay my surgery if I have to visit specialists again. Any advice?
Mid-20s and Considering Bariatric,"Hey yâ€™all. 

Iâ€™m in my mid-20s and am considering bariatric. My family isnâ€™t supportive but my husband is. 

From those of you who are younger and did this - do you recommend it? Do you wish you had done diet and exercise instead?

Would love your insight. Thanks. "
What to take,"What is the one thing you absolutely needed when you were in the hospital that the hospital did not provide?

My first NSV! Would love to hear your favorite ones too!,"Iâ€™m 2 1/2 weeks post op, down 12lbs since surgery and 42lbs from my highest about 3 months ago. 

Yesterday, my â€œskinnyâ€ jeans were so loose and saggy that I actually had to buy some leggings on my lunch break because I couldnâ€™t take it having to hold them when I walk anymore ï¿½ï¿½

I LOVE hearing NSV stories. They are so encouraging and get me excited for the future. What are some of yours youâ€™ve experienced through your journey? "
Who has dealt with constipation?,"I think today is only my second day with it, but I feel so awful. I didnâ€™t get my protein in or my water intake yesterday because I felt so nauseous. Iâ€™m trying to force down a yogurt for breakfast now. One of my incision spots that is still sore hurts from the straining and Iâ€™m afraid to give it anymore strength for that reason. I tried mineral oil last night, but it didnâ€™t help. Iâ€™m going to try really hard to get all my protein, water, and meals in today. Any other advice for me? I had my wls on February 5. I was debating a suppository, but it isnâ€™t on my list of things I can do for constipation, plus on them I know they say either ask a doctor or donâ€™t use if you have high blood pressure."
Just had my first naysayer,"A friend of my family just messaged me out of the blue, spouting off instances of people that had problems with WLS (gastric bypass when I'm having a VSG). I know she meant well but fuck, I've talked with many doctors and medical professionals. I think they know the outcome better than she does. 

I politely but firmly told her that but I needed to rant here. I've been debating about this for almost 2 years. I don't need or want people telling me the potential consequences. Fuck.

And as for her friend that had problems, those complications are common if you overeat. ""You have two young kids at home."" Exactly. Why the fuck do you think I want to lose weight? I don't want to be the fat mom anymore. I don't have to have a stroke at 35 like my dad did because he was extremely overweight. 

10 more days until my surgery."
PLEAS SHOWER ME WITH SUPPORT,"first day pre op diet and iâ€™m struggling. please help!!
Edit: i do not want to take a shower with you"
Went on vacation and lost 2lbs! 300lbs to 165lbs in 11 months.,
I'm a gulper.,I was wondering how long after surgery can you gulp water again?  I'm still on the fence and am worried about dehydration.
How did you decide between VSG and RNY?,"Last week I had my final consultation with the doctor and he wanted me to choose one of the surgeries.  I thought this was weird, shouldn't the doctor choose?  He said he thinks I could do either one with success.  I was leaning towards the sleeve since it's less invasive and I don't want to worry about any malabsorption issues.  He only slightly recommended the RNY since I have GERD issues, stating both procedures end up on the same supplements anyway, but said I could do the sleeve if I don't mind managing the GERD with reflux medicine.  I have heard that with the sleeve, some people develop reflux or get it worse, which would be awful because it's already pretty bad.  I decided that if I can get away from having to take medicine for it I should.  So I switched to RNY.  I am still not sure this was a good decision.  Does anyone have any insight or suggestions?  How did you choose which surgery, or was your doctor more decisive for you?  TIA.

My before and after. 2 years post op vsg and 5 months post op skin removal. I had lost 150 lbs,
What to tell work?,"Hi! Great news - I am officially at the scheduling stage of my journey and looking at a â€œnext monthâ€-ish date. I started a new job a few months ago and donâ€™t feel comfortable telling them itâ€™s WLS. I donâ€™t have that sort of relationship w my boss. I also think it will be considered a voluntary surgery and they will want me to push it off if they learn what it is. I would be super vague about it but itâ€™s a small company and I think that would just lead suspicion. I have a daughter so maybe I can use postpartum/childcare excuse. Iâ€™m hoping someone here will have some ideas.

Edit: itâ€™s VSG surgery"
Worried about visible results at my size (M/35/509lbs),"In going through and doing a lot of reading on this forum, it seems like there's not a lot of folks in the 500lbs and up club but I think it's a relevant question overall. I have my date to be sleeved on 08/26 and I'm just curious if there are others that started around this weight and what their results have been, with additional interest in how the weight seems to present itself as it's being lost.

The origin of this is rooted in a shift in my own body perception after meeting some folks at a WLS support group I went to. Being a guy, it was reassuring to see another guy there that was my size that was also gearing up to go through surgery about a week before me. At the time, I thought that he and I were similar in size and even my wife agreed and she's typically very honest about these kinds of things, but when we were talking about total weight loss goals I realized I weigh almost 150lbs more than the guy. Granted, I'm pretty active for my size and travel/fly pretty extensively for work (about one to two weeks a month), so I always figured I just carried it well, but now that reassurance is causing me some doubts about my own body dysmorphia. So, I started to ask my closest friends for an honest guess as to how much they think I weigh and they're all about 100-150lbs off base. While I made them swear to give me a no bullshit answer, they could have just been being nice, but it makes me wonder how this guy and I can look so similar in height and size and be so different in total weight.

This leads me to the crux of my issue. I'm worried that with WLS, my results may not be very apparent. Obviously I'll be healthier and feel better which are amazing, but because my work colleagues have been very supportive of this surgery, friends are rooting for me, and family are all excited, I'm worried about letting people down if there's some weird black hole this extra weight is living that has to be lost first before I show any real results. 

I realize this is kind of an absurd thing to worry about, but with so many people excited for me, I'm just worried about losing a ton of weight and it just looking like I've lost a fraction of it. Ultimately, I'm having this surgery so we can focus on building a family and being with my amazing wife as long as possible, but this one thing is still tugging on my concerns. 

Thanks for letting me vent a bit and any insight you guys may have."
Frustrated over hoops,"We went to meet with a surgeon today. I found out that this particular program requires 3 months supervised weight loss,  a cardiologist visit, a sleep study, and 2 meetings with the support group. While I see the value in some of this (the support group in particular), I don't understand or appreciate why this is required, especially because if I do have sleep apnea I will have to get a cpap machine and do that for 30 days on top of the supervised weight loss. Then when I lose weight and my sleep apnea goes away, I'll have the stupid cpap machine to get rid of. When I had a D&amp;C, no one made me get a sleep study first. No one required a sleep study before DH's gallbladder surgery.  It just seems like pointless hoops to jump through and more money to spend. It's my body, and this is the choice I have made. I feel like that choice is not being respected at all. I was also told by both the surgeon and the nurse not to worry about it; my insurance would require 6 months of supervised weight loss anyway. They gave me a little pat on the hand and said NBD. The thing is, they are both wrong. My insurance only requires a BMI  of 40+ or 35+ comorbidities.  I called the insurance again to verify, and I was right. This is all really frustrating to me. "

Less than a month to go and my pre diet has not gone well.,"My surgery is on 5 March. I have had it planned for the past 2 months. The plan was to go on a normal diet, not too strict until 14 Feb, when I will go on my liquid diet. I haven't gained weight, but I haven't lost nearly as much as I hoped. Currently only 5kg's. I know they want you to lose weight because of the liver. I'm worried my surgery will be canceled. I am currently 185 kg's/ 407 lbs. I am panicking. "

I'm 39, 339 lbs, 5'5"", I have high blood pressure (Managed with medications to normal BP), High Cholesterol (Managed with medications to somewhat good), Type 2 Diabetes where in I'm spending $50-100 a month/3 months to inject myself full of insulin that my body is resistant to plus pills and other injectable meds, I have sleep apnea that's not very well managed with CPAP.  

&amp;#x200B;

I want to lose weight, I've tried, but I am so bad at sticking with diets and my relationship with food sucks. I think with therapy I can manage my food issues, and follow a prescribed diet. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm afraid of the excess skin and trying to hide it and not being able to afford surgery to remove it, I'm afraid of malnutrition and being on vitamins the rest of my life.  

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that the amount of money I will save on insulin and medications and having better health justify this decision, but all these middling doubts are driving me nuts.  I have a consultation on April 8th and even today I've thought about cancelling it twice.

EDIT: Thanks for all the stories and advice everyone! I'm feeling more secure about this decision! 

I want to know what really clenched the decision for you to have Weight Loss Surgery.  If my thinking is wrong I apologize, I've been thinking about this for years, but actually making moves on it has me feeling lost in the reeds.  "
How many of you guys are open and tell people about your surgery? Have you gotten any backlash?,"I feel really happy and proud of myself for my progress so far, and  I am happy to get the surgery. I talk about it a lot both in real life and on reddit. I am surprised how many people call it ""cheating"" and saying that my previous weight loss didn't matter because I am having WLS. I've even got a PM saying that I was a worthless loser for getting surgery.

Anyone else have negative comments from being open about surgery?  I generally like being super open about everything,  especially my weight loss. But recently with all the negative comments I am starting to reconsider."
Downside Of Weight Loss?,"MY. BUTT. HURTS.

Whatâ€™s your weird post op food aversion?,"Let me explain. Iâ€™m three months post op and canâ€™t eat chicken anymore. Any variation of it, ground, grilled, shredded, nuggets, none of it. After a few bites it makes me sick (in a â€˜I throw it right back upâ€™ kinda way). I asked my surgeon about it at one of my follow up appointments and he said that itâ€™s fairly normal. Thereâ€™s no real science behind it, but anecdotally heâ€™s seen plenty of patients that have this sort of weird reaction with a food after surgery. No rhyme or reason to what it will be, but it happens. 

So I was just curious, has this happened to any of you? Whatâ€™s your weird food you canâ€™t seem to stomach anymore?

Bonus points if thereâ€™s a food you hated pre surgery but love now! Mine are shrimp and cottage cheese (not together)."

Family Doctor is Against WLS,"Hi guys,

I have tried everything under the sun to lose weight. At my highest I was 370lbs. I had hyperemesis for 8 months out of my pregnancy and lost 100lbs from the constant puking and being unable to eat.

A year ago I tried keto with fasting but hit a long plateau. I was patient, but nothing would work. My lowest was 258 but it would not budge no matter what I did

Fast forward to this year and I have gained at least 30lbs back and still climbing. I have seen my weight fluctuate wildly and am convinced that just breathing makes me gain weight.

My family doctor is against  WLS because she had two patients with serious complications because of it. One was fatal. 

I have done everything and can't find support. I am thinking about changing family doctors, but I still think about the patient she lost from the surgery. 

I was wondering what helped you decide that this surgery was worth the risk.

Update:

After a long-winded email to my doctor yesterday. She wrote back saying that she would refer me to a clinic for Weight Loss Surgery! Thank you everyone. I will be asking her for additional information and I have a ton of reading to do. I have no idea how long the wait is, but it's a start."
I was sleeved very recently and am ALREADY finding myself turning to junk food. So ashamed.,"I'm remaining anonymous, I'm so embarrassed. 

I had VSG less than a month ago and healed too quickly for my own good, it seems. I can eat anything (aside from spicy) and feel little to no discomfort. 

Here I am 10 mins ago eating popcorn. God I feel like a failure. Left the house with the BF to visit relatives last night, my mother in-law got herself popcorn from the gas station and a few hours later I caved and HAD to get myself a bag. After eating from it last night and this morning, I poured water on it and threw it in the trash just now. But I hate myself for getting it in the first place. 

It's not an emotional thing... It's an ADDICTION thing. Thought after this surgery I could have 1 or 2 bites of something naughty and that'd be it... How could I be so stupid, of course I'm going to try to down the whole thing. 

I was so proud last week when I found out I already lost 25 lbs. Now here I am eating this shit!! It seems like everyone does so great with this surgery and here I am failing already and it hasn't been a month.

God life is hard."
Struggling,"So Iâ€™m 5 days post op and the mental struggle is no joke. Iâ€™m not even remotely hungry, getting my liquids in is hard enough... but I miss food. A lot. I almost want to cry. I was going to see a movie and then I started obsessing over the thought of getting a small popcorn and just chewing it up and spitting it out. Please donâ€™t judge - I didnâ€™t do it. Iâ€™m now sitting outside of the movie theater feeling sorry for myself. Iâ€™m just going to take an Uber back to my hotel and watch tv. This sucks. Bad."

Blood Pressure after surgery,"My blood pressure keeps going down after surgery and it is causing some fatigue/lightheaded issues.  My latest blood pressure is 102 over 68.  I occasionally get light headed and lately having issues of sleeping and tired more often.  

Has anyone else gone from marginally high blood pressure to low blood pressure? What have you done about it?"
Incorporated the gym and I am having a massive stall.... WTF,"I know stalls are normal, we all go through them and often more than once. But it seriously plays on my mind so damn much! I only weight myself twice a week and I find that I'm dreading weigh ins. 

I started the gym exactly two weeks ago and literally since then I have been on the same number. Only moving up or down a few hundred grams then setting back again. This has been going on for 14 days and honestly I am fed up. 

I'm eating no different. Same amount of protein same amount of calories. 

I'll make a mention that my training involves 80% weightlifting and probably heavier weights than the average WLSer because I did/do powerlifting. Is this a factor? I very much doubt I'm even gaining muscle at this caloric deficit. 

Please someone share an experience :( "

(Mild Rant) Why are there so many inconsistencies in pre-op diets?,"Iâ€™m on Day 9 of my two week liquid diet and this has me pretty discouraged and feeling like I might be making a bit of a mistake. My surgery is on 08/26 and every day since 08/12, my daily intake has been exactly 480 calories. Three Premier Protein drinks a day and water or some other zero calorie, low sugar drink with no caffeine or carbonation. Day 3 and 4 were supposed to be the hardest and it would be a cake walk from there, as directly quoted from my surgeon. Nothing about this has been a cake walk but Iâ€™ve been holding strong and have only had one cheat, on Day 4, where I ate four small fruit gummies without thinking.

I get that this part of it isnâ€™t supposed to be easy, but the part thatâ€™s really kind of annoying is the absolute lack of consistency between surgeons on what a pre-op diet is supposed to look like. In trying to find things I could do to supplement or add to this because Iâ€™m traveling all this week for work and TSA confiscated the drinks I tried to put in my checked luggage, it seems there is no general consensus on what you can/canâ€™t eat. My diet allows for three protein drinks a day, sugar free jello or popsicles, or low sodium/fat broth. Because I travel for work, the last three options just arenâ€™t really convenient. It seems mine is the most strict diet Iâ€™ve come across in all the ones Iâ€™ve looked up and Iâ€™m concerned about the fact that Iâ€™m only getting my calories from the protein drinks. Initially I thought it was a more rigorous diet because of my size, but nope, itâ€™s the standard pre-op diet on the surgeonâ€™s webpage.

This is probably just a hangry post since my clients keeps catering foods to the office while weâ€™re onsite and my coworkers eat around me because they donâ€™t know the surgery is coming up but man, is it always going to be like this? One of the guys in my support groupâ€™s surgeon told him that there were no restrictions at all on what he could eat as long as he was conscious about it and focused on lean proteins and made sure he was staying away from sugar/high-calories. How is there such a gap between pre-op diets? Even here on Reddit and on other surgeonâ€™s pages, there are more lenient diets so I guess I just donâ€™t get it. 

Right now two things are for sure: When Iâ€™m able to ween off of them, Iâ€™m going to figure out a way to light these stupid drinks on fire. Every time I drink one now it makes me nauseous due to the flavor and cloying taste. Secondly, my wife has already decided that in no way shape or form is she going to be able to pull off this pre-op diet and so now sheâ€™s reconsidering the entire operation, which Iâ€™ll support however she wants to go. Man, I just donâ€™t get why there isnâ€™t any consistency between these recommendations. 

Anyway, sorry for the rant, but thank you for coming to my TED talk."
Should I do gastric bypass?,"To get right into it, Iâ€™m an 18 year old 5â€0 female weighing 325 pounds. My doctors are recommending me to do gastric bypass but my mom is against it (mostly fear) and I am on the fence because I am petrified.  

I have met someone who did it and she has major health issues now, she says it has ruined her life. I have also done some research and some say itâ€™s good some say otherwise. 

I just was wondering if anyone has had the gastric bypass and I just wanted to know your experience with it. The good and bad. 

Also if anyone has advice I would greatly appreciate it."
When did you start to see a difference in your body during your weight loss? Whether itâ€™s time or lbs lost.,
What were you looking forward to post surgery? What surprised you after?,"Just curious, for those who havenâ€™t had surgery yet, what are you looking forward to experiencing afterwards?

For those who had surgery, what were surprised to experience after surgery once you shed a few lbs?

Me? Iâ€™m looking forward to smaller arms and fitting into a airplane seat with extra room!"
What kind of coffee drinks do you get from Starbucks (or make for yourself at home)?,"I am looking for some mostly sugar free drink options that don't have a ton of caffeine. 

I haven't been able to make a cup of caffeine free coffee at home that doesn't taste like poo, so I've resigned to just limiting the caffeine. From Starbucks, I've gotten the iced caramel cloud Macchiato, sub SF vanilla, and enjoyed that but don't want to spend $5 several times a week. Today I searched the Starbucks subreddit for sugar free drinks and found a suggestion for the iced double shot. I got that with SF vanilla and a light splash of half and half, and while it is freaking delicious, I didn't notice that it has three shots of espresso. I can feel the caffeine coursing through my veins after only a few sips.

What do you do for your coffee fix? (Note that I've tried adding vanilla protein shake to coffee, but that tastes so terrible to me.)"

30 days post RNY - Feeling Awful,"I had RNY on 7/22 and have already lost 48 lbs but I feel awful all day, every day

-	mild nausea pretty much all day.  I never vomit but itâ€™s a queasy, mildly painful feeling in my belly.   This pain rises anytime I eat or drink.  Even a single pill and a sip of water can start the ill feeling
-	a â€œsenseâ€ of mild fever but I never actually have one
-	mild diarrhea is fairly frequent
-	mild headaches are common
-	tremendous fatigue.   Iâ€™ve went back to work after two weeks and when I get home, I basically collapse
-	complete lack of hunger

**I use the Baritastic app and here are my nutrition vitals over the past 30 days**

-	calories - 518
-	carbs - 38
-	sugar - 15
-	fiber - 7
-	fat - 15
-	protein - 60
-	water - 25
-	bariatric multi-vitamin 4x/day


**Most frequent foods**

-	protein drinks 
-	yogurt
-	string cheese
-	soups
-	sugar free popsicles


**Infrequent foods**

-	eggs
-	sugar free pudding


I know water intake is low but that should be somewhat offset by the protein shakes.   Still, itâ€™s really hard to drink the water I need because of my problems putting anything in my stomach at all.

The idea of eating anything out of craving or desire is a non-starter.  I only eat to cram nutrients in my body.

Iâ€™m going to try to get an appointment with my surgeon as well as the nutritionist.

Right now Iâ€™m feeling pretty down.  How long will this go on?  Is this my new normal?  God help me if it is.

Thanks for reading"

How to survive at a work picnic?,"So I'm 4 weeks out today and just came back to work from disability.

I haven't told anyone I had surgery so I don't want to bring like puree chicken and have it be obvious lol. Any suggestions on how to navigate this?  Any ideas for a bariatric friendly side dish I could bring that isn't obviously bariatric?  I'm on soft foods this week.

Band Surgery vs. Having Children,"Edit: IDIOT HERE! I made this post before I had coffee this morning. I meant ~SLEEVE~ not band! 


Hi there! First post so I apologize if Iâ€™m outta the loop. My endocrinologist recently suggested the band surgery for my PCOS weight gain as nothing else has worked. 

My question is this - has anyone ever had it, and then had kids? Were there difficulties? Changes? I know you need more nutrition when you have kids, so I wasnâ€™t sure if it was safe to have the band surgery before kids. 

Thanks!"
A thought; anyone else?,"I havenâ€™t even had the consultation yet, just an appointment with my PCP to run through things with him. So, Iâ€™m laying in the bed the other night doing my usual obsessing over my weight issues. And I started crying thinking about 1. the foods I wonâ€™t be able to eat regularly anymore that have been killing me my entire life. &amp; 2. not being able to eat and drink at the same time. Then it hit me just how bad my relationship/addiction to food is. I need therapy, I know. Iâ€™ll be working on that. Tell me everyone goes through the grieving of food and it gets better. 
Btw, you guys are awesome!"

Sleeved 12/13/18

I'm over 4 months out, and while it's exciting to have lost 55lbs since the preop  diet, it's really tough seeing so many with upwards of 100lbs lost, who had less to lose than I did.

I used to belong to more support groups, but I've dropped off one by one, because a) people can get crazy mean over weird stuff like drinking out of straws or eating pasta, and b) the success posts. I'm so happy for everyone, really! But it makes me hate myself at the same time. 

I'm now hitting that point where week+ stalls are a thing, and restriction doesn't feel quite so restrictive. I eat maybe 1000 calories a day, I get my vitamins, I get my protein, and it's still so. Damn. Slow.

Usually I scroll past and feel sorry for myself, but of all the support groups I've joined for WLS, this has been by far the most supportive. So I'm here, reaching out. Has anyone else had a similar progression? It's so weird to feel down and out over losing 55lbs in 4 months! And yet.

I'm aiming for 70 down at 6 months out, but I worry I won't make it. I fear every stall is the start of the inevitable regain. Stressing out about this sucks.

That is all. :)

And seriously, y'all out there kicking ass on your journeys? Keep kicking it! You all are an inspiration."
WLS Plastic Surgery (loose skin removal),"I am in the process of getting plastic surgery for loose skin and wanted to share some of my pricing.  This is just my pricing in my area but I am hoping that it will give guidelines for others these are all US dollars.  This is from a top hospital in the USA.

* **Bilateral Upper arm brachioplasty : $6000**
* **T-Abominoplasty: $9100** 
* **Combined T-Abominoplasty and buttock lift: $9200 (alternative to save cost on just tummy tuck)** 
* **Bilateral Breast/lateral chest lift: $4900**
* **Bilateral thigh plasty: $7500**
* **Buttock lift: $4000**
* **Lower face and neck lift: $7900**
* **Overnight stay: $850**

&amp;#x200B;

After speaking with doctor they think three surgeries will be required to complete it all. And he would recommend the tummy tuck and butt lift first. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hope that helps with any of you considering skin removal.  If there is anything wrong with post I would gladly remove but there is always worries about excess skin and thought this would be a baseline. "

Premier Protein Clear....crazy bitter???,"I got the raspberry flavor protein water from Premier protein. I wanted something to drink to make sure I get my protein in for the day. I know that people can have trouble EATING enough protein, so I thought at least I could sip on it. It was SO BITTER. And I'm not a pansy with eating or drinking things that are not yummy. It is what it is. But did anyone else experience the super bitter flavor? I mixed a crystal light packet in with it and it helped a little."
Just venting. Rough day.,"Today is day 4 of pre-op liquid diet. 10 more to go. My bowel movements are gross. I am exhausted. Iâ€™m tired of these shakes 4 times a day. I want garlic bread.

The hospital called to tell me that theyâ€™re estimating my cost is almost $18k for the surgery, they donâ€™t see a max out of pocket on my plan, etc. I called insurance for the millionth time and they assured me that I do have a max out of pocket, not even half that high, and Iâ€™ve almost met it anyway. Everything is covered and in-network.

Why are people trying to mess with me while Iâ€™m starving and still trying to go to work and do my job. Stop it. I worked REALLY HARD for six months to get here. I verified the insurance aspect of this multiple times before I even had my consult. I jumped through all the hoops! No more hoops!!!!!

My surgery likely will not be until 2 or 3 in the afternoon when the day comes. I feel like Iâ€™m just going to be a limp noodle by the time itâ€™s here. Canâ€™t wait to be on the other side."
Never feeling full?,"I had RNY on 2/25 and so far everything has been very smooth. Recovery was great and Iâ€™m on the soft food stage. My nutritionist suggested 2oz each meal because I should be feeling full after that much. But so far, Iâ€™ve had that amount and more and I havenâ€™t felt full. Ever. The only signal I get that I ate too much is when I have an uncomfortable BM about an hour later. My PCP said it might be my hormones being a little off and the synapse isnâ€™t firing to let me know Iâ€™m full, so I might go see an endocrinologist. Has anyone dealt with this?

Iâ€™m mostly just frustrated because I donâ€™t WANT the option to eat more. Thatâ€™s why I had the surgery! I donâ€™t want to stretch my stomach or hurt myself. Thoughts?"

Superfoods for Healthy Hair,"We've all learned through the years that a well-balanced diet is healthy for our body and critical for optimal health and performance.  Our hair is no different. A mixture of protein, complex carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and iron are all required for healthy, strong hair.  

&amp;#x200B;

Proper hair nutrition begins with getting enough protein, which is the building block of your hair. Then you need complex carbohydrates to help assemble the proteins for hair growth. Other essential vitamins and minerals include B complex, which is associated with energy production and building good hair and skin issues, folic acid, B12, and zinc.

&amp;#x200B;

Hair follicles can have low energy levels just like we do.  Therefore, it's very important that you eat a high protein meal at the start of each day.  Consider the following food choices for breakfast and the other daily snacks to give your hair the healthiest opportunity to grow and thrive. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't have high cholesterol, try eating red meat twice per week.  It has the protein your hair needs but also is full of B vitamins, iron, and zinc, which are all critical for healthy hair.  Bacon is another excellent choice as it's also full of B vitamins, zinc, and protein, but since it's also high calorie, it's not the best choice if you're also trying to lose weight. 

&amp;#x200B;

Eggs and egg whites are another great protein option, especially for vegetarians or those who cannot eat red meat or bacon due to dietary restrictions.  Salmon is another excellent protein choice and works great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  You'll find it's also full of B vitamins, including B12, and other vitamins and minerals.  

&amp;#x200B;

Just be sure to keep in mind that you should also have complex carbohydrates, which feed you energy over a more extended period than refined carbohydrates, with your protein source at meals. Brown short-grain rice is an ideal form. It's also a good source of B vitamins and some fiber. Whole grain choices complement your protein consumption by helping organize the proteins for the hair to utilize for optimal growth and health.

First weigh in.. did I gain as much as I thought?,"All week I was stressed out because letâ€™s be honest, since by group nutrition class, I hadnâ€™t had the easiest time following the guidelines of the nutritionist and all that Jazz. I think thatâ€™s the reason I showed up for my appointment a day early! Lol. When I went back in for the correct day, I was anxiously awaiting the best part, getting weighed. Lo and behold, in the first three weeks since the group class, I lost 12.6 lbs! The nutritionist said, wow! And gave me a high-five. (reviews online said she can be a bit of a hard ass, but I had a very nice appointment) she mentioned again in the appointment later and the intonation in her voice stressed how accomplished I should feel.  I havenâ€™t been perfect, at all, but Iâ€™ve come a long way from where I started and this is good motivation to keep me going, and continue to do even better.

I was so determined at such a young age , and I managed to lose over 30 pounds in a span of 9 months after following a low-carb , high protein diet ( My mom even set a mini gym at home for me ) . However , no matter what happened , I always gained the weight back . Over the course of 6 years , I lost weight so many times only to regain it back . A few months ago , the daughter of my momâ€™s colleague had the gastric sleeve and lost a ton of weight , and since I obviously wanted a permanent fix for my problem , I begged my parents for the surgery . I went to the doctor , and in about a week ( after getting all my tests done ) , I had my surgery . 
 As you can probably tell , I am over the moon currently ï¿½ï¿½ ."

Celebrating the start of a new life!,"So my best friend just had RNY yesterday. I'm up at the hospital sitting with her. I am almost 2 months post RNY and down 47 lbs. I am SO EXCITED, for her today, but in general for both of us! This is the start of something great! 

Please leave any post surgery tips you wish someone had given you so that I may share them with her, along with mine. â™¥ï¸"

I am so happy that I had surgery!,"It took a while to get to this point. I was so incredibly nauseated and exhausted for the first month and a half and I was kind of thinking â€œis this really worth it?â€. But the last 2 weeks have been pretty great! Iâ€™m finally used to the diet and I donâ€™t feel sick anymore! Plus Iâ€™m looking good! We went to Disneyland 2 weeks before my surgery and my sisters and I got matching shirts. I am wearing that shirt again today and I canâ€™t believe the difference! Itâ€™s only going to get better! 

P.S. how do I put a picture in the comments?!"
What do you eat in a day?,"I am curious as to what you guys eat in a day, post-op sleeve or gbp. 

Leave it in the comments^^"
How long was your longest stall?,"I'm almost 4 months out and other than a short one week stall when I was 3 weeks post-op, this is my first stall. I've actually gained a pound in the past week. I know it's ""normal"" and it will pass, but it's so incredibly frustrating. How long was your longest stall and how far out were you?"
The big day!,Getting my mini bypass tomorrow morning!! Send me good vibes and your best advice for after surgery!!!
Meal Prep containers,"Hi all, 

I'm looking for containers that I can use for Meal Prep that aren't huge. It seems like a lot of the ones marketed for meal prep are very very large and I end up over filling (and eating leftovers, or grazing for the whole day) OR under filling and feeling like i've not eaten enough or that it's stupid to use the containers. Does anyone know of a reusable container that's specific to bariatric diets? I'm currently using a bunch of tiny containers and feel ridiculous with the sheer number I bring to work each day. Other solutions also welcome!"
I hate shakes.,"Hi everyone,

I'm almost 5 weeks post-op and really struggling to hit my protein goals. Most days, I'm only getting less than 20g.

I have tried countless protein shakes and they all make me physically gag. I have tried a few unflavoured protein powders which were definitely not unflavoured to me, even though I mixed them with very strong flavours, and I also can't stomach them because of the taste. I've also tried protein waters and I absolutely hate them too.

I also hate yoghurts right now, too.

I don't mind Optifast, though. Otherwise, I like a glass of milk, and I try to have an egg most days. I'm starting to have some lean deli meats. And some weetbix. That's about it.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? It seems so difficult to sneak any protein in, and I read about everyone having shakes etc to help, but I've tried so hard with shakes that I actually feel grossed out just thinking about them now. ï¿½ï¿½

Help please x"
Anything Creative to do with the Pre-Op Diet,"Hi Everyone,
My pre-op diet is protein shakes (pre-made or powder mixed with skim/fat-free milk or water), clear broth, sugar-free beverages and popsicles. 

Is there anything creative that I could be doing within the pre-op diet? Iâ€™m on day 2 and feeling a bit â€œhangry.â€

I bought some sugar-free salted caramel flavoring syrup and decaf coffee crystals to add some variety to my shakes. 

Any other ideas?"
I finally got my surgery date!,"Ok, so I found out a few weeks ago that my surgery was approved and my date for RNY will be August 28, 2019. I was hoping it would get moved up, but Iâ€™m just happy it is finally happening!"

Getting closer to my VSG,In an hour I am going in for an iron infusion. Recent bloodwork showed I am a little low in iron so my team wants me to get this infusion done. I am a bit nervous. I always tend to think worst case scenario and its draining. However my last weigh in is next week on the 31st. Then my surgeon will review everything and submit the paperwork. It has been a long 6 months and I am excited for the change. I feel like it was just yesterday I was sitting in my bed and watching the orientation video for my program. I have kept this process pretty quiet so I apologize for my ramble. It is nice to just get it out. Hope you all are having a good day! You are beautiful!!
Date,I have a surgery date! 12th July on the provision I've completed everything I need to. So nervous yet excited! I'm getting the gastric sleeve done!
WLS and pregnancy,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

So previously I was focused on getting the gastric balloon, however I'm now considering all my options. I'm currently 207lbs and am aiming to get to 140lbs. In a couple of years my SO and I would like to have another baby. I'm just wondering if anyone has had any issues with dealing with a pregnancy and a gastric band/sleeve at all?"
Heat rashes,"Since I had my surgery 14 months ago I have a new problem. Skin folds. As the summer heats up sweat - especially when I exercise is causing heat rashes. I thought I would share the solution Iâ€™ve found.
Sulfur soap. Easily available on amazon and at some health food type stores. I think Whole Foods is one. It isnâ€™t stinky just sort of neutral scented but it is a natural antifungal. Iâ€™ve been using it for the last 2 months and not one rash since. Previously I was getting them in my belly button, under my breasts and under my belly fold. 
If youâ€™ve ever had these rashes they itch and are painful!! I just thought Iâ€™d share with a community they would understand and maybe it would help someone else."
Had vsg on Tuesday,Starting wieght 326 surgery weight 314.6 current weight 301!!!! I'm days away from being under 300!!!!
Two-year Checkup,"Iâ€™m on cloud nine. Two years out of surgery! My surgeon is happy with my progress, the nutritionist says Iâ€™m doing great, weâ€™re starting the paperwork for an abdominoplasty/tummy tuck, my bloodwork is perfect. Hang in there, yâ€™all. Those first few weeks and months are so hard but if you stick with the plan your surgeon puts you on and commit to your new lifestyle, you WILL see changes and turn your life around. Itâ€™s so worth the temporary stress of surgery recovery and liquid/soft diets!

New me - size 14, no chronic pain, normal hormones"
"Whirlwind Year, looking for some advice (pre-op, RNY)","Hi everyone, recently joined and everyone seems friendly so I will put myself out there.  Always heavy but hypothyroidism took it's toll on me 14 years ago.  went from 215 or so to 379 on January 24th 2019.  I know this because I broke my ankle and foot, almost every bone in there (16 breaks that the surgeon could count).  This after breaking my left wrist on 11/4/18, both attributed to my weight in my opinion.  I am actually fairly active but apparently have gotten to a weight where I am clumsy.  


I was already in my 6 month pre-op weight checks so I was in the program (have been since 8/16/16 when I attended the seminar and cried myself home from it because of the estimated cost, which has thankfully reduced and I have certainly met my deductible now this year).  I managed to get down to 349 during my recovery which is impressive to me because I was bed bound for a few weeks and unable to walk for 10 weeks total, walking now is still painful but I push through.  


I was approved last week officially and have an estimated July or August date (my pre op apt is next week, should find more out then).  


Going along with this, I have been disconnected with many in my life over the past 9 months or so.  I have been in a clearing state, clearing things from my life, useless possessions and friendships.  I feel like I am growing up.  Anyways, my New Years resolution was to not be the one to call or text, I have always been the person who plans the get together or hanging out.  I quit doing that and even through my injury, I didn't hear from many people, but the ones I did, I know they are there for me.  


So with that, and the decision to get RNY, along with hiding a lot of this from people at work or my family.  I have hit a pretty bad funk, I am so hopelessly lonely right now.  I need conversation and reassurance.  I know that I am going to change a lot after I get this done, and I know it will open some new doors of confidence.  It's just.... it's getting there, it's the waiting that's so hard.  I guess it is all coming together, painfully, for me.


TL|DR: A lot of change in my life, indecision and impatience"
Had my first consultation today!,"It went pretty well. They think I'm a good candidate, but want to double check with my psych evaluation to seal the deal, so to speak. I take medication for depression and anxiety so I'm hoping that those conditions won't cost me the surgery. That's my main worry. 

By the way, is anyone else on this subreddit autistic? My surgeon believes that VSG would be best for me as an autistic (less plumbing changes to maintain/deal with on my own vs RNY), but isn't against me getting RNY if I perform well on the psych evaluation. Personally I'm more comfortable with not rearranging my insides if possible. Although if RNY is what's ultimately recommended, then I'm fine with that. "
Stomach Pains,"I am 6 weeks post op and I get stomach pains first thing in the morning,  no matter what I eat. It isnâ€™t terrible. I would describe it like cramps. Does anyone else get this or know what may be causing it?"
My surgery is in 8 hours but I canâ€™t sleep!!,Iâ€™m so freaking nervous. Iâ€™m happy with my decision but I just have this huge pit in my stomach and canâ€™t sleep.
First day of phase 3 diet ...,"... and I immediately overdid it. I'm not puking. Yet. But I feel yucky. I didn't eat a ton, but I think I went too rich. Bleggghhhh."
Here comes the gas,So today is day 2 post OP and the gas pains hit over night. Wow the lower intestine is not happy right now. Lots of cramping and little gas releases.  At least its moving right!
Major NSV today,"I got my first random compliment today! A woman that I hadn't seen in a year did a double-take and said that I look amazing! It was a major ego boost. I'm 50ish lbs down now and I can't really see it. My husband says that I am definitely losing and he can see it on me easily but some random person seeing it definitely makes me think, ya know?

Anyway, I just wanted to share."

Endurance exercise food?,"anyone doing marathons or cycling? looking for feedback on what you're eating while doing endurance exercise.

&amp;#x200B;

I use Gu, Cliff Bar Blocks and Bonk Breakers during cycling (30-100 mile rides). I eat 100-200 calories every 45-50 minutes but typically start to run out of gas completely around the 2:45-3:00 mark and was looking for ideas on how to get past that wall.

""Carb loading"" before hand does not seem to make much of a difference, I've tried potatoes, pasta, sweet potatoes, etc.

 I typically burn 1500-2500 calories per ride and was wondering what other folks used."
"Bariatric Surgery looming this year, health issue and alternatives?","Hi,
I've been on the program here in the UK for coming up 3 years, not been in the bariatric clinic for over 12 months as I was referred to psyc services to make sure I was mentally prepared for it all, I've more or less finished with psyc services and should be going back into the bariatric clinic in the next few months what I was wondering if theres any alternatives around the corner to the bypass?, also I've noticed what appears to be diastasis recti (Abdominal separation) not had it confirmed by Dr but it looks like all the YT videos about it, has anyone else had this and had the surgery?, is it ignored or does it need fixing before or after?

Cheers"

What are your maintenance calories?,"Think about going into maintenance soon, curious to hear how much people are eating.

Why People Hide Weight Loss Surgery - WLS Life,
Weight gain almost 2 years post op,"OK, I've got to admit that I am not doing so well mentally. I had GB July 2017 and had great success, almost 75 pounds down in 5 months, by my one year surgiversary, I was 2 pounds shy of my surgeons target weight and about 27 pounds shy of my onederland goal. In the past 9 months though, the scale seems to just be trending up. I've put on 20+ pounds in the past 60 days, and I'm now over 250 for the first time in over a year.

I know I can eat more. I know I don't move as much as I should. I seem to be reverting to variations of old food habits. I am dejected. I'm grateful for still being 100lbs down from my high point, but I don't know what to do. I still want to hit onederland, but I can't see it happening. What's the path forward? What diet? What exercise? I relied on the tool to get me to my low point, but I didn't use that chance to go further. I am committed to doing what ever it takes and I'm open to all suggestions. "
Does anyone know the best place to sell size 28/30 in the UK?,I know there's ebay/depop etc but I never bothered looking at those sites when I was looking for size 30 clothes because there wasn't much. So I was wondering if there are any specific groups or pages?
Questions you wish you asked before surgery?,"Iâ€™ve been lurking here for a while and I was hoping some of you might have some insight for me:

Iâ€™m having my second meeting with my surgeon in a few hours, (hopefully to set a date!) and Iâ€™m really terrible at asking questions. Are there any questions that you wish you knew to ask before you went in? 

Iâ€™ve been asking questions of my dietician and psych as I go through the process, but I donâ€™t know what I should be asking right now! Any help/insight would be appreciated, thanks!"
3-week stall,"I was feeling great. I lost 65 pounds after getting sleeved on 3/22, then I've been stalled for 3 weeks. Super frustrating."
I feel like a disappointment. Can anyone relate?,"I'm going to my surgical consult soon and I'm basically the same weight from when I started this journey. Granted, I have major depressive disorder and at one point in March I was 13 pounds heavier than I am now, I'm still  worried about what the surgeon is going to say. I feel that I have made so many changes diet-wise, but I have very bad chronic migraines that are brought on by exercise, heat, thunderstorms, coffee, perfume, red onions, sunlight, everything basically that I just haven't left my house in months so my weight has just stayed the same."
I have my 6 month appointment on Monday. Is there anything I should be asking my doctor?,I know for sure I plan on bringing up questions about my calorie intake because I sometimes get dizzy spells. I donâ€™t know what else should be asked?

Itâ€™s happening!,I went from not knowing if Iâ€™d be able to get the surgery due to insurance issues to now Iâ€™m going to have it in a week and a half! Iâ€™m super nervous but Iâ€™m so ready to start this journey. Iâ€™ve been starting my presurgery diet in stages so I donâ€™t get completely ruined by it. Any tips for nervousness as the date gets closer?
Question for DS patients and feeling full,"Had DS 12/31 and I switched to soft texted food Tuesday. I'm allowed 2-4 spoonfuls but the Dr said I should stop when I feel full. I haven't felt full yet. I'm not even sure that I'd say I've felt hungry yet. There have been textures I've wanted. Love me some scrambled eggs. 
I felt discomfort when I didn't want to leave a half spoonful of eggs and ended up consuming 4 heaping spoonfuls. Was that full? What should it feel like? 

On another note, do people find they burp a lot now? Especially when walking around? Dr said it was from taking in too much air when drinking. It's embarrassing either way lol

Thanks "
Parenting Question for the WLS Crowd,"Hi all! 

I was sleeved in October 2017, and went from 275lbs (at 5'8"") to 170 a year later. I bounce between 170 and 175, and have never felt better. 

In April, my husband and I found out we are pregnant, and will welcome a little boy in January! Everything is going well and our son is looking goos at every scan. 

75% of my weight problem was due to an endocrine disorder which the weight loss seems to have fixed. However, I recognize the remainder stems from my mother's unhealthy relationship with food, which I picked up. 

I eat pretty healthy, but I also rely on weighing food and consciously timing my meals...which I know can model an unhealthy control-style approach to food. 

I want my son to be able to make healthy food choices, eat til he's full, then stop. 

Any advice on modeling a healthy food relationship for kids, after going thru bariatric surgery? Thanks in advance!"
5 years Post VSG,"Just a quick note, Itâ€™s a slippery slope, donâ€™t screw yourself up. 
Itâ€™s just 5 pounds.   Itâ€™s just 10 pounds.  Itâ€™s 15 pounds? Itâ€™s 20 pounds?  
Well now at 30 pounds I need a kick in the ass."
I have my final meeting with surgeon tomorrow before surgery.,"He was very vague about what we'd be going over (""physical, medical history, and going over things""), and I already have a surgery date.. Does anyone who's already had surgery had a final consultation/meeting? What did you go over with your doctor? I'm probably just anxious about everything but also I like knowing everything haha"
2-Month Post-up Check-in Today: Down 53 lbs (73 since start of pre-op diet)!!,"....And I also hit 100 lbs down exactly since I started my journey last August at my highest (known) weight.  

It's weird. The idea of losing 100 pounds seemed so remote just 10 months ago.  Like,  I knew that a 100+ pound loss was what the process promised if I stuck to it, but it just seemed unfathomable.  Yet here I am, and now it feels like 100 lbs is only the beginning.  

For all my pre-op friends out there: It really works.  And it's worth it.  Good God is it worth it."
I beat my pre-weight goal by two pounds!!!,"I went to kaiser today to get my ""close to achieving goal"" weigh in. I thought I would be 3-4 pounds away from my goal but no... I was actually two pounds less than I thought! I LOST 27 LBS IN 2 MONTHS AND AM MEETING WITH A PSYCHOLOGIST IN A WEEK!! I can't believe it's happening, oh my god. Now I am just afraid I won't pass that due to night eating problems lol. Does anyone have experience with the second psychologist meeting?"
NSV - New (Old) Polo Wardrobe,"This morning I was looking for something to wear to work and got the urge to try on a shirt that was in my closet since a different one I wore a few days ago looked better than when I bought it. Well the one I tried on fit, so I tried another and another. They ALL fit!

6-7 years ago I bought an entire wardrobe of Ralph Lauren/Polo because of the job I had and needing some business casual clothing. I don't know when, but at some point that stuff stopped fitting. Well, I'm back in it and sorry excited! Gotta try the pants next!"

Insurance questions...,"Hey yâ€™all, this my first post. Iâ€™m 22 6ft5 HW 472 CW 444. Iâ€™ve got my last appointment with a nutritionist this Thursday 3/7/19 and then Iâ€™ll be cleared for surgery. (Hopefully)

Has anyone ever dealt with BCBSTX, Iâ€™ve having a hard time getting these nutritionist appointments approved, my bariatric center has an in house RD that Iâ€™ve been seeing and sheâ€™s currently billing the appointments as nutritional therapy, my contract with BCBSTX only covers nutritional counseling. 

BCBSTX  requires I have 3 months of tracked dieting with a nutritionist before they will approve my RNY, Iâ€™ve been going round and round with my RD and BCBSTX seeing if I could get it re submitted, as my RD stated they were the same thing. 



Thanks for any help guys! "
Anyone tried this program? I think it might be helpful post-surgery.,"I came across this website today that describes itself as an online treatment program for food addiction.

Consult Tomorrow,"Hey everyone, tomorrow is the initial appointment and beginning of the 12 week countdown my insurance requires for WLS. I am not really sure what to expect but I feel excited. I am in Los Angeles and will be going to UCLA for the appointment. 

I have spoke with a few people about my decision to pursue this option have been met with mixed reviews. A few people have flat just said ""you dont need surgery you have lost weight before without it"" to ""that is amazing that you are taking control of the situation"". I have admiringly been on both ends of that spectrum internally as well. 

I just really want my life back. I want to remember what it feels like to not be uncomfortable all day every day. I hope this is the first step of positive journey. Any thoughts or feedback from people who have been through it or are gearing up like myself would be appreciated. Thanks."
Who has used medicare to pay for WLS and how much did you pay out of pocket.,"Original Medicare (part a) . I was looking into it and looks like there is around $1300 delectable, plus possible daily fees for a hospital stay.  Was that about what it actually costs or did you pay much less, or more ?  


Backstory..My wife has lapband in 2011 (self pay from 401k withdraws), lost weight to begin with then it stopped. Over the next 6-7 years she never gained the weight back, but also didn't loose even half of what she needed to....Jump to 2017, diagnosed with a rare condition (moyamoya) causing several strokes requiring 3 brain surgeries. In 2018 neurosurgeon said due to her weight he would be unable to preform any additional surgeries and recommended she have a revision surgery to gastric bypass or similar.  That would lessen the risk of more strokes and make additional surgeries possible.   


She is a tribal member, covered by indian health services. Her tribe's insurance does not cover any weight loss operations. Their policy was to goto council and request approval on a case by case basis. They initially approved it, she had all the diagnostic testing done, consultations, approval from her doctors, etc...Then when she was ready to schedule surgery Tuesday they came back and said they likely would not approve the surgery.   


But because the strokes in 2017 left her disabled, she automatically got medicare part A coverage, it became effective 8/1/2019.  Her clinic said she  could use the medicare coverage to pay for the surgery since they likely won't cover it, but said there will be out of pocket costs but didn't know how much they would be."
Update to Psyc issues,"Former post: https://www.reddit.com/r/wls/comments/blzyv5/psyc_issuesagain

Had my final appointment with the psyc. today. I'm approved by psyc officially now and my next steps are to meet with the Dietitian and then have my pre-op appointment. I was able to get these both scheduled for next week, so things are moving faster now.

For anyone who read my last post and are curious. I did eat small amounts of my trigger foods as the Psychologist recommended. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. They taste different now and I feel bored with food and not really hungry any more like I was before. I suppose this is due to snacking steadily throughout the day with high protein/low carb foods and planning out my meals with a big meal prep on Sundays. There are no surprise foods, everything is planned and logged."
Freaking insurance appeal,"I just found out that my doctorâ€™s office, who told me a couple weeks ago that my claim had been denied and they were figuring out how to appeal (expected) STILL hasnâ€™t figured it out. I guess they were waiting for a letter from the insurance company which never came. So now theyâ€™re hopefully getting the information, but even once we start the appeal it will be at least a month, and Iâ€™ve already been on the pre-op diet for almost three weeks. Itâ€™s also more urgent for me than standard because Iâ€™m getting the surgery for my gastroparesis, and any delays mean more hospitalizations and organ damage and blah blah blah. So Iâ€™m frustrated."

This is the only before picture I could find. I canâ€™t stand it. But, it does show the progress Iâ€™ve had, at least face wise.


Really puts things into perspective, because my brain has not caught up at all with the weight loss. My clavicles are starting to pop out as well!

Best NSV Ever!,"As I have mentioned here often, my journey started with being declined for life insurance.  The insurance company was convinced I would be dead before I was profitable.  Yesterday I reapplied for life insurance with the same company, and was accepted. More importantly, I was accepted without any extra fees or increased premiums.  I have life insurance because I am now expected to live another 20+ years rather that less than 5."

It's definitely a tough place for wls patients and I'm only bringing carry-on so can't bring a lot of snacks with me. They're known for spicy food and alcohol sooo.. gonna be an adventure :).

Has anyone gotten around Korea post-op? And good snacks to pick up? I know I can grab fruits and things, but I get bored of that pretty easily after a few consecutive days. I'm 6 months post op at this point, but I still feel very restricted when eating so I eat a lot of small meals.

IF after RNY questions,"I was wondering if anyone else was doing IF. How long do you fast? How do you meet your caloric needs? Has your weight loss increased/slowed/stayed the same?

&amp;#x200B;

I have been doing IF for about 10 days now and I've seen no change in my weight. I'm doing IF and Keto. I'm not eating a lot at this time, but I'm not entirely certain how many calories I should be eating. I'm a little over 8 months out of surgery. I do understand we hit plateaus and stalls, but my weight loss has slowed significantly after the 6 months mark.   


Any answers or advice is much appreciated! Love this community."
Abs,"Iâ€™ve been searching WLS for years and noticed big chances after years of people struggling, but Iâ€™m curious to know is a six-pack possible after undergoing any of the surgeries?  Iâ€™m curious, because it would be cool to show off to the haters."
Phase 2 any good recipies for fresh food,
weight loss after revision and return to sports,"I am having my VSG converted to RNY later this month due to serious GERD issues, as well as the fact that my sleeve has stretched to more than double in size. (Surgeon says the imaging shows it's not due to anything I've done, but rather a connective tissue disorder that is also being investigated.) I weighed 300lb when I had VSG, lost down to 150lb, and am now about 220lb.

I understand that weight loss is likely slower after a revision, but can anybody share their rate of progress? I'm aiming for 170lb as an initial goal and trying to prepare myself for how long it might take to get there. I was initially very successful with my VSG and plan to work hard (and maintain) with RNY.

Also, for anybody involved in sports before surgery, how long did it take until you were able (both surgeon clearance and personal judgement) to return to sports? I play roller derby and my doctor says I'll be cleared to skate again in 4 weeks, but that sounds awfully quick, especially for a full-contact sport. I remember being extremely fatigued for the first several months after VSG and I'm trying to figure out a rough timeline for return to the gym, skating, etc.

Thanks!"
Another step closer to surgery,"So I had to go through a year long program and lose 10% of my weight in that time. At the end of March I'll be finished with the program and I have met the requirements. 

In other good news, one of the bariatric surgeons in my area has finally started performing the duodenal switch. It's the procedure I've wanted from the time I decided that wls was my best option, but no one in my state was performing it when I researched my options.

All I've got left is to have my psych eval and then I can start the official application process. I'm hoping to have surgery around November."
NSV at work!,A customer at my pharmacy told me today that they remembered me from when I first started working at my pharmacy (October 2017; 400lbs) and that I look amazing now (250lbs) and theyâ€™re proud of me. Itâ€™s one thing to hear it from family and friends but to hear it from a stranger is amazing ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
WLS and MS?,"I am in the process of getting a VSG.  I am getting surgery clearances from a pulmonologist and a cardiologist this week.  Once I get the clearances they will submit to insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

My question though, does anyone here who has had wls have Multiple Sclerosis?  I was diagnosed 2 years ago.  My neuro is fine with me having surgery, but I wanted to hear others experiences.  Did it prompt a relapse, was recovery harder, etc.  Thank you!"
Just bought â€œmy groceriesâ€ and other goodies!,"I stopped by ProCare just outside of STL, MO and got 90 days worth of vitamins and various calcium supplements! They gave me a bunch of freebies too! Iâ€™m excited that I made my pre-surgery weight loss goal (3-5 lbsâ€”I lost 7 lbs) and am scheduled for surgery on 7/30/19! Iâ€™m hoping to lose some more with the liquid diet!

Liquids and protein shakes diet starts 7/23/19! 

A Few Observations

-Since I stopped eating a lot of carbs and sugared foods, Iâ€™m not craving them as much

-Iâ€™m officially done shopping! Iâ€™ve got a wardrobe of dresses and leggings that will get me through the first few months...plus an entire wardrobe of size 12-16 clothes I couldnâ€™t wear, but wasnâ€™t ready to donate. Right now Iâ€™m between an 18-20 with my 18s pretty snug! Iâ€™m so excited to see Me 2.0!

-Iâ€™m grieving the loss of Diet Coke and sparkling water BIG TIME!

Thatâ€™s all for now!"
Just starting my process,I just found out the hospital I am going to for wls is taking me on as a patient. I know I will have many months of pre-op stuff but any suggestions on lifestyle things to keep in mind or start before surgery is greatly appreciated!
Final Visit and Stumbling Blocks,"Had my last visit to the Nutritionist yesterday and she gave me the thumbs up for surgery, I'll need to double check with the program coordinator to be 150% sure but she said I should know in January a surgery date for Feb.   


\--   
Part 1? maybe 2 ?   
I broke my elbow on December 4th an accute fracture which required plates, screws, 30 staples and a 10"" incision on my arm. they were giving me percocet for the pain 2 every 6 hours which caused me to be loopy at best and sleep for 10-14 hours a day. the times I was lucid (sober?) I was eating like a dumpster.   


when you lose track and fall of your path what I've found is to take an almost military like approach and make a strict outline of when where what.   


I log my food religiously even if I know Its crap Im eating so later I can look back and know that the ""Thing"" I ate was 200 wasted calories or the like. 

  
Have a plan to drink your 65 oz of water a day, I do 20oz Morning, 20oz afternoon and then 30 minutes after dinner I'll drink down another 25oz.  

  
No Straws, for me this is easy enough I dont like straws anyways

  
the hard part for me is I eat like I'm a starved dog getting a pile of meat so I leave myself notes to chew, taste my food and take a full 30 minutes to consume.. its not a race. -- for this I leave myself reminders on my phone in the way of alarms so I can a msg about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, Automate as much as you can so you dont have to think about it. Grab the pre-packaged food you've prepped or give yourself visual queues so you know how far you are from your daily/weekly/monthly goals. "
Learned my first post-op lesson!,"I had a RNY on 7/31/19. All went pretty well, home after 1 night in hospital (walked a lot and took in all my water) Had mild cellulitis a few days post-op so was put on antibiotics. Besides that one complication, been feeling great! Down around 15 lbs. Thursday night I didnâ€™t sleep well at all, so ended up sleeping off and on until about 2 P.M... BIG MISTAKE!!! I was so behind on fluids and protein that I ended up with horrible abdominal cramping and ended up vomiting for the very first time post op. Please take care of yourself folks!! Dehydration is no joke and we have all these guidelines for a reason. Definitely a lesson learned!"

Sleep study consultation,"Hello all, 

I have my sleep study consultation today, not the actual study. Am I about to have a physical after I am hot and sweating all day at work? (Iâ€™m a teacher, our building is god awful hot)

Sleeved a year ago (6/12/18) and have lost 122 pounds so far...,But my tailbone is hurting and Iâ€™ve begun commuting for work on the train. Any suggestions on how to quickly build butt muscles? If possible Iâ€™d love to hear from folks who have built the muscle and a time frame. Iâ€™m walking daily always meeting my 10k steps goal as I walk two miles to and from work. I know squats can help but I donâ€™t have that much time for the gym yet and I need some relief. Iâ€™ll probably buy a donut soon to help when sitting on train.

6 month check up today,Today I had my 6 month check up. I had a minor GI bleed in May of which my iron is still coming back from. I'm at like 17 when they want it closer to 30. I'm ok with it being at the low end of normal at the moment as it was a few days of black poop followed by a colonoscopy. At least the bleed wasn't too bad. Any way I'm also to add in B12 now 3 days a week as I'm getting low on that. Again not the end of the world. I've dealt with low B12 before surgery so as long as I can avoid the shots I'm happy! I'm down weight wise about 85lb. Started at 291 and came in at 207 today. Over all I'm happy with it all! My goal weight is 150ish
NSV: dr took me off all blood pressure meds 3 weeks after surgery.,On both of my meds my BP was 86/50. Strangly I felt okay. Now Ive been off my BP meds for a few days my BP is 117/70. Yay!

Surgery was 3/25/19 and I am free of these worries! Down 60lbs.  


I still can't shake the ""will this seat accommodate my weight"" thought. At the snack bar I wanted to give my feet a rest by sitting on an ice chest. It totally should have accommodate my weight, but I never allowed myself to take such risks - so I just stood - all damn day. I'm still scared of lightweight furniture, too. I will have to start experimenting with chairs to let go of this hang up.

Chest pain after eating? 6 mos post op...,"I am 6 months months out from surgery and Iâ€™ve been getting chest pain after eating. I mean *immediately* after swallowing something. It even happens with just water or a single bite.

If I have a little hiccup or anything it hurts the center of my chest as well. Itâ€™s starting to radiate between my shoulder blades as well now.

Tomorrow Is The Day - RNY,"I'm on the last day of my 14-day fast, and tomorrow I go in for RNY. I've been a little nervous the past few days, but generally I'm incredibly optimistic. I think more than anything, I'm just ready to get it over with. I fought the idea of surgery for a long time, but all it took was me catching sight of myself in a cruise ship balcony window to really decide to make a change.

I'm 6', 288 currently, but at my largest I was 320lbs. Last year I was diagnosed as pre-diabetic and placed on Victoza, which helped but would plateau after 12-15 pounds lost. Other than that, and being classified as morbidly obese, I'm pretty healthy for a 39 year old. We've had 2 kids and I was also on a mood stabilizer that wasn't very metabolically beneficial. It's become difficult to work out, and even worse when you can't see the results like you think you should (I boxed and weightlifted a LOT). I'm excited that I'll be able to do that again soon.

I used to have a monster sweet tooth (which appears to have gone away, since I haven't had any sugar in 2 weeks), especially chocolate. I don't think I relied on food much, but I do know I would snack when bored or just kicking around. Mindless eating. The only thing I've craved has been pizza, and that's been because I encountered someone close to me with a slice nearly every day this week (can't wait until I can have a piece of crust or slice of bread again).  The only cheating I've done was 2 shrimp and 5 French fries, and that was all in week one. I've been really diligent about it, and I feel like that will be super beneficial as the process goes along.

More than being able to fit in the expensive assortment of clothes that were never/barely worn from years ago, I'm more excited about being able to run around with my kids and keep up with their activities. Even being able to have sex with my wife without stopping to gasp for air is going to be nice. And I can't ignore the fact that I'm always afraid to fall asleep in hotels, for fear that I might not wake up (my wife says I used to stop breathing at night, and since I travel a lot for work, I never get a good night's rest because of being scared). 

Thanks for all of your stories and comments that I've read in the past few days. Seeing how supportive everyone is here, will definitely help with the questions and feelings that I'm anxious about asking my wife (she's 8 years post) and one of my good friends (she's 3 years post). I can't wait to share some of my own!"

They drew blood to test vitamin levels, protein, etc, so I am really interested in getting those results. I told them honestly that while I get all the water and take all the vitamins, I havenâ€™t been making the 100 gram/day protein goal. My endocrinologist doesnâ€™t like the high protein (Type 1 diabetes for 20 years) and asked me to stay closer to 50. Iâ€™ve been splitting the difference and getting 65-75/day. The Dr said the labs today will tell them if I am ok with the lower protein amount. They did say that the body comp scale they use showed that I lost all fat and no muscle, so thatâ€™s great! 

Best decision ever!"

"Early Pre OP ""reset diet""","Projected sleeve surgery in Oct/Nov. 
I had a weight check and my first nutrition appointment today. I've researched so much and am a part of many groups I check every day so I was aware already of what was being discussed. 

My nutritionist gave me information on the ""reset diet"" or the liquid pre-op diet and said I could do it now if I wanted to. Said it would help cleanse all the bad stuff out and get the crappy cravings to stop. Once I complete it then follow the bariatric eating/plating plan. It will help kick start my metabolism for weight loss. 

Is this normal? Did any of you do the liquid diet during the pre-op process but not directly before surgery? What kind of results did you have?"

100lbs down today - sleeved 7-12-18,
The only thing keeping me sane five days post op is my pregnancy pillow,"I honestly had no idea I would need or want this after surgery.

They help sleeping on my right side (no incisions over there) but they help for back sleeping too. I just kind of wedge it up against the side my drain was on and it makes every thing feel more.... secure. Cant recommend this thing enough."
When can I have a bath?,"I had sleeve surgery on 15th December.  The thing I am struggling most with is not being able to have a soak in the bath.

I have 5 wound sites, with 'dissolvable' stitches. The ends of the stitches seem as stiff as ever. The nurse I saw a week ago to check them said they were healing well. I know it can often take longer than 2 weeks for them to dissolve.

So when can I have a soak?"

Question: Has anyone here had WLS after diagnosis of EoE (Eosinophilic esophagitis)?,"Hello all.

&amp;#x200B;

Been on the pre-approval from insurance journey for a while. Just when I met the requirements, they changed them (new year, new requirements). Depending on my sleep study results I may or may not qualify.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, along the way while working out a suspected GERD issue, we discovered I have EoE. Summary: It's a chronic immune system issue, fairly new so not a ton of research yet, and it's an allergy issue. Can be an allergy to my own reflux, environmental (suspected this is my issue as I have BAD environmental allergies), or food allergies.

&amp;#x200B;

I've read some forums where people with EoE had WLS and it helped. I'm worried it'll be a reason for them to deny me though. Has anyone here dealt with this?"

Yesterday morning  I stepped on and was down to 248.6, which is nearly two pounds lower than my 'oh shit' weight. That weight, 250, was basically my first milestone, where I knew this was real. 

Looking at how quickly I got here, after preparing for 200-225 as my goal, I realize that I'm going to end up a lot lower than I thought.

July 2018 vs July 2019. VSG on 1/17/19. HW 393. SW 340. CW 235.,
Revision VSG to RNY - what are the chances of getting insurance to cover it for medical necessity?,"I had the VSG in 2016. Lowest I was down 60 but now Iâ€™m down 35 because I had a baby and went through a divorce since then so I had about a year of being off plan. 

I am in horrific pain every day from heartburn. No matter what I eat, what speed, if I follow the doctorâ€™s guidelines 100% I am still in heartburn pain after 15 minutes. I take Tums like nobodyâ€™s business. Iâ€™ve tried ranitidine and famotidine, trying nexium now. 

I wish I would have done RNY but my original surgeon talked me out of it. At the time my insurance covered the surgery but I have new insurance and they donâ€™t have coverage for bariatric surgery. Am I basically SOL? Should I just look into Mexico at this point or is there a chance insurance will cover it to fix my GERD issue?"
Any other dairy free WLS patients here?,"I'm about to start to move to some soft foods, my doc has me try about 3-4 different foods at a time for 2-5 days before moving on. The first stage is sugar free yogurt, sugar free applesauce, and cottage cheese. Being dairy free due to allergies I am of course having trouble finding some of these items. I found a lower sugar plain dairy free yogurt that I can blend fruit into to help make it taste good, or can add vanilla bean paste. Cant for the life of me find a vegan cottage cheese but I have found a ricotta. Anyone else have trouble subbing out some dairy free diet items? What did you try? 


To get specific, I cannot have lactose free items, they must be completely dairy/dairy additive free. Vegan tends to be an easy way for me to go with dairy products as I know for sure it does not contain any cows milk or cows milk derivatives. Suprisingly, goat and sheeps milk is ok but again unless I haven't looked at the right place is hard to come by. Thanks in advance for everyone's thoughts and suggestions!"

A trick that I use to help me feel a lot fuller on the pre op liquid diet.,"So protein shakes only leave me really really hungry. So what I started doing is adding a bunch of ice and my whey protein into a blender and letting it blend for 3 minutes or so. Something with the ice and the whey protein makes it really airy and take up a lot more space. It makes the drink more of a smoothie consistency with no added calories. What would normally be a 2 cup protein shake turns into a 6 or 7 cup smoothie. 2 scoops of whey protein with 40 grams of protein keeps me full now for several hours this way. 

Seems to only work with whey protein. I tried it with some plant based proteins and it didn't work at all. 

Anyone else do this?"

Hi, I had bariatric sleeve surgery one october 25, 2018. the last 6 months have been a total roller coaster ride for me. It hasn't always been easy, but has definitely been worth it. I've totally had to learn how to eat again. The right things to eat, the right quantity, the right way. I'm down 80 lbs and its fantastic, but sometimes i dont see the changes that everyone else sees. It when i look at pictures, like this 4 month time lapse where i can start to see the difference. If anyone is interested, i have a youtube channel where i give a very honest weekly update of my experience. For everyone going through this, keep it up, you can do it.

I had RNY 8ish months ago and Iâ€™m down about 135 since surgery. Iâ€™m visiting NYC and crashed with a friend in Brooklyn who invited me out to House of Yes. Side note: Itâ€™s an awesome club and I highly recommend to anyone looking for a fun night. I used to turn down offers like this, making excuses because I knew I would be uncomfortable not just from dancing but from taking up space. I thought I hated dancing, but now I know I just hated my body. A kind of startling realization since I was/am very body positive. 

The best thing about wls is how I have discovered this whole other side of life I wasnâ€™t taking advantage of, and now I can. My body is able to sustain dancing for 3+ hours 

So this is my NSV. Dancing at a dance club in New York City and absolutely loving every moment of the night!"
Just starting this journey,"Hi everyone! As the title says, Iâ€™m just starting this whole process and have committed myself to this way of life to better my heath and future.

Iâ€™m doing my research and getting myself immersed into everything that I can to make this work for me. Iâ€™m still in the very early stages and Iâ€™m going to a seminar on July 1st - required by my Dr. as the first step.

What kind of process did you go through in making this life changing decision?

Is there anything that you would change or do differently in the early days that would have made things better for you?

What is the most important question/s to ask your Dr. at the first appointment?

Is there anything that you have learned about yourself that has not only made your weight loss successful, but has made you a better person?

I probably will have loads of more questions and thoughts as time goes on, but I wanted to get some ideas from some seasoned vets out there and also get to know everyone in this community, hopefully to add some additional support.

Thank you in advance for sharing!"

First real food and no pain/fullness??,"Hi,

Just moved phases. Ate a small pack of tuna and two small crackers and I didnâ€™t feel any fullness. Granted Iâ€™m not hungry, but I was expecting to feel some restriction. Is this normal? I had rny."
Scope sites gaping,"Hi everyone! 
I had laparoscopic rny surgery on July 23rd (3 weeks ago) and had my staples removed on day 12. 2 of my scope sites are not well approximated and seem to not be scabbing over like the others. They arenâ€™t oozing or smelly or even red: just a bit open. Did anyone else experience this? Tips?"
Looking for a wls buddy!,Hey yâ€™all! Iâ€™m about a month out from a RNY and back at college for my second year. I also work part time. I was wondering if there was anyone here in a similar phase of life or needing a wls buddy! I just feel like making a friend going through a similar journey as me would be awesome. Iâ€™m a 20 year old female as well. Thanks and best of luck to all of you!

In the process,"Hey guys, Iâ€™m in the process for a gastric sleeve. Iâ€™ve met with my surgeon, scheduled my nutrition classes and now Iâ€™m just getting clearance from cardiology, pulmonology and psych. 

I do have a few questions for those who have gone through the surgeries because Iâ€™m, frankly, an anxious nutball. 

For reference, Iâ€™m a 24yo female, 5â€™9 and currently weighing 410lbs. Iâ€™ve been overweight my entire life, my first diet was when I was six months old. 

- those with chronic pain (I live with MCTD), did your pain get better after weight loss? They promise me it will but I donâ€™t want to get my hopes up. 

- suggestions for combatting loose skin after? Iâ€™m a CNA, Iâ€™m active and I can lift weights like nobodyâ€™s business but I need guidance. 

- how do you add in activity vs rest? I want to be one of those cute jogging girls, and Iâ€™m planning to be, but again, HAAALP haha. 

- clothes? What do I do?? Goodwill every time I need pants? Or is there some secret subreddit?

- Iâ€™m having a hard time with the idea of a liquid diet, any help? Ideas on what liquids? 

Thanks everyone"
Is This Normal?,"I'm just over 4 weeks post-op and been having issues keeping anything on my stomach the past few days. Until now, I've had no problems, but now anything I eat kinda runs right through, even liquids. Yesterday I was pretty achy, weak and tired  too. Almost like it's a bug.

In pretty sure I am not getting in enough liquids, but I can't seem to drink more than 32 ounces in a good day. 

Is this normal or do I really need to look into this deeper? (I'm already considering calling the doctor, but just looking to see if anyone had experienced something similar)"
Did anyone here have WLS approved by Tufts health insurance?,"I'm falling""right on the line"" with a lot of qualifying factors. My BMI is 37, I don't have diabetes. I'm going to be tested for sleep apnea but I don't think I have it. I didn't think I had hypertension but I may be wrong. I just looked up the most recent criteria for diagnosing hypertension and the AHA states three readings of 130 over 80! My BP is usually around there but not at 140/90. I'm just wondering if the insurance companies can use different guidelines and state that 140/80 isn't hypertension or not hypertensive enough to warrant surgery. Or maybe they don't care as long as my PCP writes u have this diagnosis. 

Does any have a similar experience or any insight if my 130/80 BP should be enough to qualify me?"
Looking in California,"I live in a part of California that I will have to drive 2 to 3 hours for a good wls center.  As of now I am looking at Fresno Metabolic and Bariatric, or Cottage Center For weight loss surgery in Santa Barbara.  I was also interested in UCLA but I don't think my insurance is accepted (Blue Shield). Does anyone have any experience with any of these locations?  "

Just had my gastric bypass operation yesterday!!! Feeling a bit of pain. Definitely still gassy and bloated. Any tips or trick for gas? Especially in chest?,
Waiting on insurance approval,"The jitters are real, yâ€™all!! I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m officially done with the program and just waiting on the thumbs up from my insurance. Iâ€™m 99% sure Iâ€™ll be approved given the fact that I meet the physical requirements and my insurance tends to be very keen on approving bariatric surgeries, but thereâ€™s still that part of me that is scared I wonâ€™t be approved. They said 7-14 business days until I find out if I got the green light to schedule or not, so hopefully Iâ€™ll be posting again with a date soon!"
BOOKED!!!,"I canâ€™t believe it!!! I literally JUST posted here a couple hours ago about submitting my insurance approval.  

Guys... it took only 24 hours and they just called to tell me Iâ€™m approved!

My date is November 11. Iâ€™m so nervous, excited, and everything in between. 

Any surgery date twins out there?"
Low dose aspirin,"I had my 6 month checkup with the nutritionist and social worker yesterday and everything is going perfectly. I asked about taking a low dose aspirin daily because of my age. Neither one could answer that question and suggested I ask my family doctor next week. I know I'm my family doctor does not know much about the RNY. Anyone here ever get a chance to ask?

Calories and macros for maintenance?,"Over the last year, I lost 160 lbs, from 278 to 118. I had surgery 7 days ago for a breast lift and augmentation with implants, so Iâ€™m now quite swollen and showing 121 on the scale, so Iâ€™m estimating Iâ€™m going to settle around 120 when it goes down. But I have had a hard time figuring out what maintenance should be, my original goal was 125, but I continued to lose from there to 118, which is fine for me. Iâ€™m small framed and I exercise. I look healthy and have been building up muscles in my arms and legs especially that I am very happy with. I have been very low on calories since surgery because I was nauseated and was barely eating for about 4-5 days, but am now back to a more normal routine. 

I have been anywhere from 1200 to 1800 calories in a day, and I wear a Fitbit so it keeps track of my activity. Iâ€™m just not sure what a good number for maintenance should be. Iâ€™m of course still going for my protein goal (80-100g a day for the modified DS), but Iâ€™m not being as strict with my carbohydrates because Iâ€™m no longer trying to lose. Iâ€™m not sure how to stay on track without overdoing it. 

My nutritionist says itâ€™s basically trial and error, and has not given me a caloric goal at all. I wanted ideas of what has worked for others. I also did a bmr calculator that said I use about 1500 calories a day to exist. I work a job wear I  am on my feet most of the day, but not heavily active. I get my 10,000 steps each day, though. 


TL;DR: Iâ€™m not losing anymore. How do I maintain? What should my calorie goal be? How do I figure that out without risking losing more or gaining?"
The Scale,Can someone explain how I can eat &amp; drink water with the same calories roughly give or take every day and have the scale have a minimal variance of up or down 1 pound for two weeks and then one day Iâ€™m 4 lbs less.
Okay soooooo,I've been on this journey since July 6th of last year and had sooooo many stupid ass hurdles to deal with. I know theyve made me a stronger person but still. Well great news is my nurse is submitting my paperwork for insurance approval either tomorrow or sometime next week. Fingers crossed that i get a day soon!!!!!!! Omg so fucking happy.
Feeling strong and powerful today. Great morning workout. Sticking to good foods with good fuel. Down 90 lbs. 40 to go to get to my goal. Shorts like these were always way too tight even as a kid. Big win here!,
Iâ€™m feel like Iâ€™m getting the run around from my psychologist for the insurance mandated psych eval.,"Iâ€™m sure everyone has a different story regarding this part of the process but Iâ€™m really starting to worry about my psychologist. She is incredibly nice and weâ€™ve talked about a lot but Iâ€™m starting to feel like sheâ€™s leading me on. 

For example, weâ€™ve had 2 follow up sessions so far and she ends each one by scheduling me another appointment to discuss â€œstuff she may have missedâ€. She always assures me that from what she has seen of me sheâ€™s going to clear me for surgery but that she just wants to keep meeting up until Iâ€™m â€œout of the clear for binge eatingâ€. But I have a friend going through this same process and her psychologist just passed her through one and done. Not to degrade her but sheâ€™s a lot worse off than I am. I cannot get her to go to the gym with me and sheâ€™s always complaining about her food temptations. Iâ€™ve somehow overcome these things with help of my nutritionist and her excellent advice. But yet this psychologist just wonâ€™t get off of it. Any advice? Anyone else experience this or the other?"
"My eyes are so much bigger than my stomach, lol. I meal prepped 5 of these for this week and canâ€™t eat even 1/2 of it. Yesterday I left the spinach and tomato and had it with a Boca burger for dinner. Same today I guess. I do miss being able to eat a big salad. :)",
Gastritis?,"Anyone have gastritis or have had it?  I went to my pre-OP and he told me he was going to do a scope beforehand to check for ulcers.  I had one in early 2015 and couldn't remember why.  I found the paperwork.  I had a ""stomach flu"" 3 times over a 6 week period and they did the scope.  Didn't fund much but did not some gastritis.  I also have GERD.  

Now, I feel like those symptoms are long gone though I have had a few bouts with that stomach bug since, nothing out of the norm.  No real symptoms of nausea or vomiting.  My bowels have been a bit irregular lately though I have been eating a lot of greek yogurt and tuna and I think I am just adjusting.  

Just looking for some help, I don't want this to hold me back of course, and I don't know that something from 2015 would still be lingering without me knowing it."
Sleeved two days ago- omw to physical and emotional healing,"As the title indicates, I had the sleeve done two days ago. It was a long journey, and a difficult decision to come to, but I did it! I pulled the trigger. After dealing with the consequences of being engaged to a â€œfeederâ€ in my early twenties, I am SO ready to leave that past behind me for good!"
"I'm just over a month post-op VSG and over the past few days I've realized that every time I eat something, anything at all, I start having these weird burp/hiccups on almost every breath I take. Any knowledge as to why this is happening?","  I've just started eating soft solids again, so I thought that might be it, but it's even happening if I eat a pureed food or a yogurt or something like that.  It doesn't hurt or anything, but it's really annoying and uncomfortable.  If you guys think it is worth it, I'll call my surgeon's office, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.  Thanks for all the help!"
"9 months out, 90lbs down","Got on the scale this morning and I couldn't believe I was 189lbs! My heaviest was 279lbs. That means that as of this morning, I am 90lbs down and as of 4 days ago, I was 9 months out from my RnY surgery. I am so flipping happy, I feel like I am walking on clouds. My whole life has changed since the surgery: I have so much more confidence now. I go out with friends and flirt with boys who actually notice that I exist. I don't have to try on 4 different outfits before finding something that looks good on me. I fit comfortably on public transportation and I'm not usually the fattest person in the room.
Being firmly rooted in ONEderland is amazing. I'm so happy I had my surgery. Anyone considering WLS should do their research, make sure you are in the right place emotionally because it is hard. But it is such a helpful tool. Thank you for this amazing community!"

Am I Doing This Correctly?,"Iâ€™m 10 days post-VSG and I feel like I can take a normal drink of my beverages. Iâ€™m not taking tiny mouthfuls anymore due to discomfort. Is that normal so soon? 

I almost feel like nothing happened. Iâ€™m not on solids yet, so perhaps thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™ve had my stomach downsized. 

I can tolerate a 6 oz cup of yogurt. Iâ€™ve never vomitedâ€”not that itâ€™s a right of passage, but I almost feel like myself. 

I wonder if Iâ€™m eating enough food. This is surreal! 

Anyone else feel this way?"
"Surgery is tomorrow, got cellulitis in my leg today. Oh the joy!","Like the title says, surgery is tomorrow morning. Been doing my clear liquids since yesterday. I felt a bit off yesterday, but chalked it up to the diet. I woke up this morning with pain in my lower right leg. It's tender, red,  and hot to the touch. Definitely cellulitis. I've had it before. On call doc called in antibiotics and said to assume that surgery would be postponed. We live several hours away  from the hospital and were going to stay overnight up there tonight. I'm waiting for on call doc to get in touch with my surgeon to see if he indeed will postpone. I'm trying to stay chill about this, but this is a bummer right now. F in the chat, as the gamers say."
Terrible acid reflux and I feel like I have a lump of food in my throat every time I eat.,"I am a little over two weeks out. I just started the soft food purÃ©ed food stage. Every time I eat anything like refried beans or mashed carrots or soft eggs I feel like it is stuck in my throat.  And I am getting some epic acid reflux. Doc prescribed protonix and carafate. Looking for insight and advice. I am trying to eat slowly and chew chew chew!  Oh, and I have been stalled for 5 days!"
Worried because I donâ€™t have many standard post-op issues (that I was expecting/ready to embrace),"Iâ€™m worried that maybe something could be wrong with me (not that i think Iâ€™m dying and not calling my surgeon lol) because I had RNY October 19th 2018 but I donâ€™t deal with a lot of standard stuff

-I donâ€™t feel MUCH restriction but I donâ€™t test it either which is what worries me the most 

-Alcohol pretty much affects me the same as it did before (I know I shouldnâ€™t drink but I wanted to see + New Years)

-no dumping syndrome, at all (kind of disappointed because negative reinforcement would be nice)

-my tastes havenâ€™t really changed

I know itâ€™s not guaranteed how surgery will affect you, but the only difference I feel is that I canâ€™t take big bite or it gets stuck. Other than that I feel like I didnâ€™t even have a surgery and itâ€™s a little weird?

Reaction to bariatric advantage HPMR mix?,"Hey guys! I began my pre-op liquid diet this morning and used the iced latte bariatric advantage mix. Within 10-15 minutes I had a terrible burning stomachache and felt like Iâ€™d been punched in the back. I was sweating and nauseated. If felt really awful. After an hour I started improving, but two hours later I still have a bit of a stomachache. Iâ€™ve called my surgeon and Iâ€™m waiting on a call back to see what I should do. 

Did anyone else experience anything like this? Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s just my bodyâ€™s reaction and not anything wrong with the mix itself."
Is it normal to be so nauseated?,"I am on day six after having surgery and I have stuck to the recommended diet completely, but today and yesterday I have been so nauseated! Is that normal? Iâ€™m trying to get all my walking in and I have been drinking tons of water, I just donâ€™t know what to do!"
Anyone used the Green Chef meal kits?,"They have Keto meals that are pretty high in protein per meal. I'm looking at a shrimp dish that has 24g of protein per serving, and a chicken dish that's 45g, but I know those are also for the full servings which I wouldn't be able to eat. 

I was wondering if anyone has used them before and how big the portions are and how good the ingredients are. I've used the Plated meal kits in the past and I like those, but I like that Green Chef has meals that are high protein forward since I'm still struggling to get my protein in every day, and also some fruits/veg.

Nearly 1 month out and Iâ€™m still experiencing extreme nausea... is this normal??,Itâ€™s basically the title. I am almost 1 month post op vsg and Iâ€™m still experiencing severe nausea. I honestly donâ€™t know what to do eating makes it worse honestly eating is probably the worst part of my day because I know Iâ€™m going to be curled up in a ball for hours just trying to stand for nausea. I had my two week postop appointment and I told my doctor about the nausea and he said well your body still adjusting so it makes sense but now itâ€™s out of control. I am on the soft foods to eat so Iâ€™m still trying out a lot of things but all foods seem to have the same affect on me (except yogurt learned that the hard way) I donâ€™t know what to do to stop her not sure at this point so if you guys have any tips or suggestions would be great.
Plastics after weight loss?,"I have hit my weight goal and am in maintenance now, and I recently had my first skin surgery. I had a breast lift and augmentation with implants a few days ago.

In the process; looking for advice,"Hi ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 
I started the process on 5/30. I saw a bariatric surgeon and he thinks Iâ€™d be a good candidate for VSG. Iâ€™m having to 4 months of monthly weigh ins with my pcp, an EGD, labs with EKG, a psyche evaluation, and dietitian appointments per my insurance company. Iâ€™ve already completed the EGD, labs &amp; first pcp appointment. Iâ€™m really nervous and excited to have the surgery done, mostly nervous that insurance wonâ€™t approve. But if they do it looks like my copay will only be around $500. 
My questions for you all would be
What vitamins do you suggest? Do you take biotin or collagen for hair and to (hopefully) help with skin elasticity? Is there a specific protein powder you recommend? If there was anything that you could go back and start doing prior to your surgery what would it be? And last but not least, if you had any advice that you wish you had known prior to surgery what would it be?"
No effects. No edits. No Tricks. No false hopes. Just plain Truth!,

BMI below insurance requirement after supervised diet?,"This may be a silly question but I was wondering if anyone was denied by insurance bc their BMI decreased below the requirement for insurance during their â€œsupervised dietâ€ period. 

Hereâ€™s my situation. I have a BMI of 40.4 just high enough to not require any other obesity related conditions for my insurance to cover the procedure. I have to go through a 6 month supervised nutrition period. Obviously the expectation and hope is that I lose weight during this time. But Iâ€™m concerned my BMI will dip below the threshold my insurance has (I have no obesity related conditions so if Iâ€™m under 40 BMI I would not be covered by insurance). Even if I lose weight during that time I know I would regain it without this surgery (based on past experiences). Iâ€™ve asked a few insurance coordinators about this when deciding which doctor I want to go with and Iâ€™ve gotten different answers. Just wondering if anyone has had this situation? "
Gastric sleeve and PCSing overseas???,"This may not be the right place to post this but I wasnâ€™t sure where else to reach out. Are any of you married into the military? My husband recently got orders to Germany and our report no later than date is in August! We are both incredibly excited. 

however, I am terrified of the medical clearance screening. I wonâ€™t be a year out until July 30th. I havenâ€™t had any issues with my surgery but itâ€™s up the the person that does the screening. 

Do any of you have experience with PCSing overseas after VSG? What happened? Denied? Did you go? Please help. "
WLS recipe subreddit?,"Sorry if this is a dumb question or the answer is blatantly obvious somewhere and I just managed to miss it. Iâ€™m wondering if there is a subreddit where people post their wls friendly recipes? I currently subscribe to 1200isplenty, 1500isplenty, and eatcheapandhealthy but they still usually include foods I canâ€™t have (yet or ever like rice and pasta) or foods that donâ€™t agree with me. So does a subreddit like this exist?"
Home at last!,"Iâ€™m home from surgery, yay! They had to keep me an extra day because I could not keep even one tiny sip of fluid down without vomiting until this morning. Let me tell you, if I never vomit with fresh incisions in my abdomen again it will be too soon. 
I also kept having blood pressure spikes (my bp is normally low, if anything) if I tried to space my pain meds out, so apparently I really was in a good deal of pain and not just being a baby, haha.
My blood sugar was running on the high side (average maybe 220) until today too, even though I wasnâ€™t eating anything, which has to be from the stress on my body of the surgery.
I even had slightly low oxygen, which I never have had before that I can think of, not even this low when I had an allergic reaction to penicillin.
So nothing HUGE, but a lot of little complications. 
I also have to keep an eye on my ketones, because theyâ€™re reading on the high end of moderate, and going into DKA is not something I want.
But Iâ€™m getting a little better all the time, so fingers crossed!"
Afraid of not having lost enough weight in pre-surgical program,"I have my final check-up and weigh in for my six months of weight management. My surgeon wanted me to lose at least 25 pounds and Iâ€™ve only lost 18. I had lost 30, but then I spent 8 weeks in a hotel when my job moved me to a new city and gained 20 back when I started eating out or takeaway/fast food again. Iâ€™ve been trying to turn it around, but my appointment is tomorrow late afternoon and thereâ€™s no way I can get to 25 lbs, especially since I always weigh like 4-5 pounds heavier in the evening. 

I also just have so much shame around being weighed and disappointing doctors. I even did something that I have never done before and took two miralax  pills to see if I could lose some water weight tonight. 

What is the likelihood that my surgeon will refuse to move forward with me? Iâ€™m also behind on my pre-Surgical testing. I did my psych evaluation (passed), sleep study (no apnea), Pap smear, and weight management classes, but I have to redo bloods because my TSH was too high, and am not scheduled to do my endoscopy and manometry until next month. Could I beg another month to get down? 

Is it my insurance company that needs me to lose a certain amount of weight or just the surgeon. Iâ€™m so confused (and mad at myself for not losing more). 

Any advice/experience?"
Starting to think I have a hernia under one of my incisions,"I've been noticing a cramping sensation in one spot on my upper abdomen, particularly when sitting in my car for a long time. I realized the other day that the spot is right next to an incision site and started poking around. There is a lump under my skin, about the size of a large grape. I already made an appointment with my surgeon but I'm freaking out a little. I just started a new job two weeks ago and dont have FMLA for a year. I dont have the type of job where I could have surgery and tough it out at work (work in a hospital taking care of patients) but I also lift and do lots of physical stuff and I dont think I really should be doing that with an active hernia... Has this happened to anyone else? What was it like, how long did you go before you had it fixed? How long was recovery?"
Progress! 4 months in post R&amp;Y and down 120lbs (30lbs post surgery),
Pre-op support group requirements,"As part of the requirements to be eligible for surgery, I had to attend 4 ""skills classes"" and was *strongly* encouraged to also attend some support group meetings. Perhaps these are rather typical requirements?

I completed the 4 required classes, but after being around some other participants in the program, I have absolutely no desire to go to any support groups. The skills classes ended up just being a discussion group and, quite honestly, I found the other program participants to be incredibly obnoxious. These are not the kind of people I want the support of.

They would hog the discussion to complain and their health problems and whine about failed weightloss attempts. They peddled the worst kind of fatlogic, like ""my body can't lose weight"" and ""I did exactly what the dietician said and it didn't work!"" I could tell right away that most of these participants were not serious about making the lifestyle changes necessary for the surgery to work.

I know exactly how I got in this situation and I know the only way out of it is with life-long changes to my eating habits and activity levels. Surgery is a tool to help me get there, but I know its effectiveness first and foremost hinges on being accountable for my actions.

Did anyone else similarly find that the ""support"" from these pre-op meetings was less than helpful?"
Nutrition consult tomorrow,"Literally so thankful for the responses I get on my posts. I am so appreciative. 

I have my nutrition consult tomorrow, the big group meeting. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve lost any weight since my first appointment, maybe even gained. Is this going to be a strike against me? I havenâ€™t started the nutritional portion of this, and I am ready to give it my best effort, I just donâ€™t want them to think that Iâ€™m not in this for real. 

(Sorry Iâ€™m so anxious about this! ï¿½ï¿½)"
Local clinic sucks,"Started this process for self pay vsg about 1.5 years ago. Life happened and I restarted the process again in Feb 2019. The nurse coordinator handles all appointments and never returns phone calls and is just generally useless. 

So now I'm wondering if anyone has any recs for self pay in the USA(Leaving the country isn't an option for me) and costs for vsg?"
Internal hernias post RNY,"Has anyone experienced internal hernias after having RNY gastric bypass surgery?  This is different than hiatal or inguinal hernia. This is when the small bowel becomes entrapped in a space created during the RNY surgery. That space is usually called the Petersen Space. I'm about 8.5 months out from surgery and I've had two internal hernias.  This last one was much worse than the first one, which occurred at 4.5 months post-op.  For something that has an estimated incidence of 0.9% to 4.4% in all RNY patients, I'm sure an anomaly.  This past time I almost died and was under the knife for six hours. I'm still recovering from the surgery."
Peanut Butter Banana Protein Chocolate Chip Loaf Recipe,"Peanut Butter Banana Protein Chocolate Chip loaf ï¿½ï¿½. This recipe is usually for muffins but I decided to make them into a loaf instead. Had to make two different kinds because my fiance doesn't like chocolate chips in his muffin/loaf so instead of the chocolate chips, there are peanut butter chips in the second one. ï¿½ï¿½ Preheat oven to 400Â°
âœ… 2 large bananas ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
âœ…1 cup of creamy peanut butter
âœ… 2 eggs ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
âœ… 1/4 cup of honey ï¿½ï¿½
âœ… 4 tablespoons of protein powder (I used #Unjury's Vanilla Protein Powder)
âœ… 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
âœ… 1 teaspoon baking powder
âœ… 1/2 teaspoon salt
âœ… 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips
â˜‘ï¸ 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips or nuts (optional)
ï¿½ï¿½ Place all ingredients except the chocolate chips in a blender. blend mixture approximately 30 to 45 seconds or until completely smooth.
ï¿½ï¿½ Using a spatula or spoon, lightly stir and the chocolate chips.
ï¿½ï¿½ Spray a standard muffin tin or loaf pan with cooking spray and scoop the batter into the muffin tin or loaf pan.
ï¿½ï¿½ Bake 12 to 14 minutes or until muffins have set.

I do not have any information on calorie count you can plug in the exact ingredients you use into a nutrition calculator such as MyFitnessPal for that information. This does make 12 muffins.

20 months out from VSG"
I finally hit my â€œrock bottomâ€,"Today was the first time, and last, I had to ask for a seatbelt extender on a flight. I was so embarrassed and ashamed of what Iâ€™ve done to myself, how I let my addiction take over and be so abusive to my body. I felt terrible knowing that I am holding myself back from a normal, healthy, happy life.

Luckily, Iâ€™m 90% through the process of setting up my RNY surgery and Iâ€™m 1,000% ready for the change. All I need is insurance approval and I could have the surgery as early as next month. Iâ€™ve done the appointments, taken the classes, met the surgeon, all who say I am a perfect candidate and have the knowledge and perseverance to really turn my life around.

I just wish it didnâ€™t have to come to this point. Iâ€™m trying to stay positive, but Iâ€™ve been waiting on a surgery date for a while, and so far it hasnâ€™t seemed real, like it might not happen.

At this point, I need this tool. Itâ€™s a necessity. And I am READY TO USE IT. "
Fave foods - soft solids stage,"Hi all! I'm now in the ""soft solids"" stage of my post-op diet - YAY! Lately I've been eating mostly non-pureed versions of what I had been eating in the pureed stage - tuna/salmon salad, chicken salad, egg scramble with bacon pieces and goat cheese. I also hope to start eating meatballs or meatloaf, and also some vegan meat alternatives I have in my freezer (mainly grilled chick'n).

What are some of your favorite go-tos in the soft solids category? I would love to mix it up a little and add some variety, and appreciate any and all suggestions. Note that I'm lactose intolerant - I can't tolerate cow's milk AT ALL but I can tolerate goat's milk and milk alternatives. 

Thanks, all!"
Pain in calves when starting exercise program?,"Hello!  I figured I'd ask this here because we were all most likely in a similar spot at one time - a larger person starting to exercise for the first time in awhile. I've asked other fitness subs and forums and didn't get much. 

Background: I'm currently pre op, in my 6 month supervised diet. 38/f, 5'8"", 310lbs. 

Every time I walk at a brisk pace for anything longer than like two minutes, I get pain and cramping in my lower calves on the outside. Eventually the pain is so bad that I'm forced to stop. Has anyone else experienced this?  Years ago I tried the couch to 5k program and this is what stopped me. I'm okay if I'm just walking slow, but I know I need to get my heart rate up. I did an exercise class on Saturday and was asked to walk briskly for 10 minutes and only made it 8 before I had to tap out. I've been walking at work on my lunch hours and the pain starts at around 2 minutes. I can do 10 mins before I need to stop, I've just started this last week. 

Has anyone else experienced this?  Admittedly I'm pretty out of shape, is this just something I need to work through?  I've asked both my physical therapist and the exercise class teacher (both through my bariatric program), and they didn't really have answers for me except to stretch before hand and stop when I feel pain. I am stretching, but if I stop when I feel pain I'm only walking for 2 minutes lol. 

I'm just curious if anyone else has experienced this and did it get better. I can keep walking at 2 minutes bursts if I know that'll help, I just need to know this is not something totally crazy. 

Thanks!!"
Fixing my Hair (and found my face),"I figured I show off my head along with everyone else.   

While January was a bad month for me - lost 8 pounds, gained it back, lost it again - I am down 3.5 more pounds today and broke through the stall with my eating disorder nutritionist and therapist.

I've lost a ton of hair since October and when I was traveling it really upset me.  Not only did it get really dry and frizzy, but it was also impossible to style.  I thought a hair cut would help, but the fellow cut it off at my chin!

SO I bought a wig.  It is a lightweight wig from Paula Young - only 35$ and I feel like my old self again.  My doctor said my hair will grow back to a normal state eventually, but for now, I really like it!  My normal hair has never been able to do this.  I also got a highlighted blonde wig in the same style and freaked my family out.

stuck at the same five pounds,"Hello all,

Just hoping for reassurance I guess.  I have been stuck in the same five pounds for about three weeks now.  I had a stall before of about a  week.  I am 9  to 10 weeks out.  I am guessing this is normal but it feels  like it should have broke by now.  Any words on ways to break a stall or is it just a waiting game?  I am not cheating on food and record everything.  Thanks ahead of time."
Gastric Surgery,"Hi all!

I'm looking at getting gastric surgery, and am awaiting my first consultation to go over the options that I have. I was wondering if anyone has had gastric surgery, what type did you have, and how did you find it?

I've been trying to loose weight for years, and this is something my GP suggested I could look into privately. Thanks in advance :)"
Exercise after surgery,"My surgeon said no strenuous activity for six weeks after surgery. Has anyone tried indoor rowing after surgery? I have a machine at home and want to get back onto it once I am able. How about swimming? Anyone used swimming as exercise after surgery?

Edit: I am not asking about exercise for before I am allowed, I am asking about after the date the surgeon approved strenuous activity to begin."
New to the party!,"Hey everyone!
36F/BMI 48.8

Today is my fifth day of eating healthy for the four month period of dieting to qualify for insurance.

 I feel like I have a lot of stomach hunger-like pain even though I just had my allowed snack- could this be heartburn? I'm hoping I'm not just so used to eating that I'm just constantly hungry.

I took some brutally honest before pics when I started this, with the goal of having something to compare myself to later on."
Weightloss Documentation Requirement,"My nurse from the bariatric services department of my insurance company (that was a mouthful!) said that I needed 6 months of weightloss documentation from any combination of doctors and programs (like WW it Jenny Craig). I sent the form to my pcp and sheâ€™s making it seem like it has to be 6 consecutive months with just her. Who is correct? I was planning to submit my doctorâ€™s appointment records and WW records. The insurance company is UnitedHealthcare, if that matters.

(CAN) RNY v. VSG,"So I need some help. I received my orientation date today for the end of the month and it's made it so real. In Ontario the surgeon decides which surgery you get, and I just found out it's only 2 out of 100 that get the sleeve which is greatly my preference. 

I take advil almost weekly for migraines (i have chronic migraines) and i have surgery every other year or so that requires morphine or oxy afterwards. I can't take those if I have the RNY. 

Also, i've worked so hard to start my career in a large accounting firm as a CPA and i'm terrified i'll be set back by dumping, ulcers, hernias, bowel impactions, etc. To me it's just too big a risk. 

Does anyone know if there's something I can do or bring up that would get my surgeon to agree with me about having the VSG instead of the RNY? Something that would disqualify me from the RNY but not the other? 

"
My preadmission testing had some abnormal result and I'm freaking out,"I got the results from my patient log in. Some things I expected like having a fatty liver. But other things made me worry they're going to move or cancel my surgery while I'm in the home stretch...  

My spleen is enlarged, my urine was cloudy, my white and red blood cell counts were high, and I'm anemic. Has anyone had results like this and still were able to have surgery? I'm seeing my surgeon in ten hours for my final appointment but I'm having trouble keeping my head together."
(Update) Got an appointment,"Just wanted to give an update for my last couple of posts, in case anyone was interested. I had my first appointment this morning, and I barely passed the weigh in with a 40.06 BMI! Furthermore, I asked the doctor if my insurance would cover the surgery if I lost any weight, and was told that they only use the starting weight. I feel so relieved that I wonâ€™t have to worry about making myself heavier before each visit.

Iâ€™m finally doing this. Iâ€™ve already made three appointments - nutrition group in February, behavioral health intake in March, and one-on-one with a dietician in April. Thereâ€™s also a surgery discussion group later this month that Iâ€™m not required to attend, but they strongly encourage it. Iâ€™ll have to see if I can make it.

Anyway, thank you for all the support!"
Mini bypass or sleeve!?,I have my surgery date.. July 24th! My surgeon will do either of these two procedures. Does anyone have any thoughts? Side effects worth taking into consideration? I had my heart set on the mini bypass but there seem to be a lot more potential side effects.
Was just referred for a consultation,"Hi yâ€™all! So I had a physical last week and was referred for a wls consultation. Iâ€™m a 5â€™6 23 year old female and I weigh 265. I donâ€™t have any health issues other than obviously being very overweight. Iâ€™m very excited for this as Iâ€™ve been unhappy with my weight for a very long time and I want to move on from seeing food as a hobby. My main concerns is my insurance covering the surgery, as I donâ€™t fit any of the qualifications other than my BMI, and what surgery to choose "
5 days post surgery: an update,"Hello everyone,

I had my bypass procedure Thursday morning, and my hospital stay lasted longer than I was expecting.  Basically, my surgeon found a hernia that had to be repaired, and I was having trouble with my urine output and color - I did not go home until yesterday afternoon.

I'm home now, but I've gained almost 10 pounds since the day of surgery.  Is that normal?  I haven't ate much of anything but a few spoons of apple sauce, low sugar Greek yogurt, and some protein shakes (premier protein).

I am using the bathroom once every 2-3 hours, and my urine is clear or a very light yellow, so I don't think I'm retaining water or dehydrated.

Any advice would be appreciative.  Thank you"
Had my RNY 14/06/19 start weight 95kilo starting to feel human again,"I had such a miserable time first couple days recovering, crying from pain and gagging from nausea which made pain worse.... was given loads of endone, morphine injections and nothing helped...Turned out I was reacting badly to an antibiotic which made me feel this way and since then started recovering Ê• Â´â€¢Ì¥Ì¥Ì¥ á´¥â€¢Ì¥Ì¥Ì¥`Ê” 

I was in such a dark place and starting to really regret my decision for a bit there.  Anyone else go through this? 

Apparently they might discharge me tomorrow so wish me luck Ê•ã£â€¢á´¥â€¢Ê”ã£"
In the hospital again,"Iâ€™m in the hospital with ketones again, and Iâ€™m so frustrated. I got a cold and I think the combination of being sick and not being able to keep up with my fluids and carbs is what did me in. I donâ€™t know how theyâ€™re going to manage my diet while Iâ€™m in here. The last time I was in I was still on clear liquids and they basically had nothing to give me but water, because the other option was juice which wouldâ€™ve caused dumping. So hopefully theyâ€™ll have some idea of how to feed me now that I can (sorta) eat. Anyway. Frustrated."
Okay here goes.... Iâ€™m new here. My first appointment is tomorrow and Iâ€™m really nervous.,"Okay so hi. Iâ€™m Canadian so all my stuff is covered under health care for freeeee. 

However, this means Iâ€™ve been on a waiting list for just over a year now. Finally I got the call last week. Tomorrow I am meeting first with the nurse and then with the surgeon. 

What is going to happen? What should I know before I go? Is it okay if Iâ€™m a bit scared? 

My dad had gbp four years ago and he gave me the following advice:

1. If you want to know the down sides of the surgery, donâ€™t ask anyone whoâ€™s had it because most people who heâ€™s talked to have nothing bad to say about it 
2. A lot of people are going to tell you itâ€™s a cop out /cheating /easy way out. This is ignorant and untrue. This is the hardest way to lose weight but also the most long term 
3. Youâ€™re gonna eat a lot of jello. No carbonation tho. Four years later he can drink a beer but not if heâ€™s driving.

So. What should I expect ? What do I need to know before tomorrow ?"
Fantome thighs,"I am now 5 months post op with 86 lbs lost (to never be found again!) and the weirdest thing just happened to me! 

I am lounging in my bed propped up on 2 pillows with my knees pulled up like I regularly do, surfing on my phone. So my phone is hiding the space between my thighs and I can only see my knees but it feels as if my chubby thighs were still there and touching but were like 4 inches apart! It's such a weird feeling!

I can see the physical changes in the mirror but I still have the ""habits"" I had when I was 86 lbs heavier, if you can call them that. I still move wayy to the side when going up or down the stairs at the office (you can easily travel 2 side by side), I find myself standing with my feet wide open, and other things I probably haven't noticed yet.

Do you still have thoughts or habits that curvy you did before wls? Does it ever go away?"
New NSV yesterday,"Now that I am almost (so close) 100 lbs down from my pre surgery weight I am trying to change myself as much as possible. Do things I would have never done before surgery. 
I took acting classes. I mean acting scenes from Apocalypse Now - yelling in your face - acting. Talking about going outside your comfort zone. 

The class starts with a meditation where we have to lie down on the concrete floor and meditate with the directors guidance. Last week (my first class) I meditated on the couch cause I was not on the ground in 15 years. I did not even sit on a low couch during that time, cause I was afraid not to get up (elegantly). 
I felt though that I needed to be on the ground to become part of the group. So I did this week. 
Getting down was surprisingly easy. Hell it was uncomfortable on the floor and my head did not touch the ground. Could not bend it back far enough to rest on the concrete. 
Now I had to get back up after the meditation was done. That was my biggest fear. To be able to get up without pulling myself up with a chair or a desk close by. 
I got up without an issue. I was so psyched when I got up. I wanted to jump up with the soundtrack of â€œRockyâ€ in the background and my arms in the air with triumph. But of course I did not and nobody noticed. 
For me this was another giant victory. Just thought I share that cause who else would understand how difficult it was/is to get up from the ground. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

Yeahhh.  

"
Finally approved for surgery... helpful pre-op tips??,"After literally MONTHS of waiting, I finally got approved by my insurance for RNY.  Hopefully Iâ€™ll be scheduled for mid-late February.

Other than the pre-op low-cal diet 2 weeks beforehand, what are some helpful tips and tricks to prepare me? Anything to do with the mental and emotional changes I can expect?"
Private insurance that covers surgery?,"My company insurance covers the surgery, but only after I've worked there for a year, qualified, and gone through a long approval process. I don't want to wait that long just to gamble they'll approve me. So I'm hoping you can recommend a private insurance that covers it. Going that route, paying the higher cost and deductible is cheaper than paying full cost out of pocket. Going out of the country is not an option for me, so I'm doing what I can."
Pre workout supplement,"I started going to the gym after about 3 months after surgery. I wanted to ask if anyone is using pre workout supplements to reduce muscle aches and to increase energy. Also are you running into any issues with caffeine?

"NSV. Got ready for an early morning meeting, it was canceled so I went on a morning jog. Who am I?!","Just as the title says! Anyways since I was still at my apartment I decided to change into my workout gear and go for a morning jog along this beach path Iâ€™ve been meaning to check out. Legitimately a sentence I never thought I would type. Well I finished my jog around 8, and now Iâ€™m sitting outside in the shade enjoying an iced coffee, and I just canâ€™t get over that this is my life now? Like I canâ€™t believe I voluntarily (let alone happily!) decided to go for a morning jog because I had free time. Itâ€™s moments like these that I am so incredibly happy with how life changing wls is, my whole mindset is so different from how it used to be. Pre-op I would have either gone back to bed or gone out for a huge breakfast. Now Iâ€™m enjoying the after jog bliss, not sweating like crazy from being in the heat, wearing short shorts and a tank, and drinking iced coffee for my breakfast. This is truly the life I want and I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™ve made it possible. My best NSV by far."
Scar Cream?,"My glue and scabs are pretty much off and I'm considering using some type of scar cream to help with the discoloration.

Revision Surgery Tuesday,"Iâ€™m going in early tomorrow (Tuesday) for surgery. The plan is to remove my lap-band and revise to gastric bypass. If the surgeon isnâ€™t comfortable with how things look as he does the removal, he might decide to stop there and wait 8 weeks to do the bypass. I totally trust his skill and opinion but I am praying that he can do everything at once. Hereâ€™s to a smooth process with no hiccups! Iâ€™m ready to be on the other side of this."
"Chart of my weight since start of the liquid diet prior to surgery (Dec 4, 2018) and the surgery itself (Dec 17, 2018) -- plateaus and all.","The plateaus have been surprising. There was a period of 27 days where I fluctuated and only lost a total of 7 pounds. That included too many calories on super-bowl Sunday and not enough exercise. 

What seems to nudge me off of my plateaus is increased activity but there's not always a direct correlation. Right after an eight-day plateau where I stayed at around 350 there was an eleven-day period where I lost 12 pounds.

I do know that the more I exercise in general the more I lose.

My exercise at the moment consists of some time on the exercise bike (my goal is 3 sessions per week) and increasing my daily walking step count. A good day will see me walk 5K steps and a very good day gets me above 7K steps. This is significant compared to what my activity level was before. Eventually I want to work up to 10K steps per day.

From a calorie consumption standpoint I average between 1,000 to 1,100 calories per day. My goals are 24g carbs, 80g fats, 70grams protein and 64 ounces of water per day.  My dietician wants me to include more fruits but I'm very happy with my daily blood sugar readings which are almost always in the 80-90 range.

When I first started showing plateaus I got nervous and wondered what I was doing wrong. The more I study and read other reports here I realize that it's just natural. I need to stay the course and increase the exercise and activity.

I hope this is useful for others.

NOTE: Initially I'd considered my 'surgical weight loss' to start from the day where I started my liquid fast about two weeks prior to the surgery (Dec 4) where I lost 21 pounds. Since then I've realized that I'm fooling myself and I need to be very literal about when the surgery took place and what my weight was at that point (399).

Took the first step!,"Yesterday was the initial appointment with the PA and RN to go over my body composition, surgery options and plan the rest of the appointments. My RN is a RNY recipient herself and is 7 years post-op so she is very helpful. I see the nutritionist next week and I will have to do 6 months of MSWL, but I am okay with that. I have been fat this long, what is another 6 months! This time will allow me to get the new habits in now and mentally prepare myself for post-op. Other than the MSWL, I will need to have a psych evaluation and bloodwork/ekg. It is looking like surgery in August if all goes well!

Reached a milestone and not happy,"Hi all, 

I am only at the start of this process and have a long way to go. I reached the two months point yesterday and had a appointment with my team who told me I am doing amazing. I have lost 40lb since I started and I started at 227lb. 40lb is my halfway point and at 2 months in I should be happy. 

However I feel very down on myself and feel like I have a long road ahead to lose the other 40lb and the 40lb Iâ€™ve lost doesnâ€™t make that much difference. Iâ€™ve only dropped one dress size. Iâ€™ve made an appointment with the therapist to talk through this tomorrow but was wondering if anyone else goes through it and how you navigate your negative feelings. I know deep down I am much healthier and it makes a difference but itâ€™s hard to feel that way at times."
"7 months post op update (VSG, Malaysia Sept 4th 2018)","Hello, Iâ€™m the poster who had surgery overseas in Malaysia as it was better than half the price of having it in Australia without private health.

Iâ€™ve basically had a dream run to date medically with no issues arising from the surgery or the fact my surgeon didnâ€™t follow the strict liquid, purÃ©e etc diet pre or post op. 

Starting stats were 112.2kgs with 121kgs my highest weight. Today I weigh 80.8kgs and have also lost 108.5cm in measurements. Iâ€™m down from a plus size 22 to a normal 12/14 in womenâ€™s sizing. Iâ€™m still losing weight at around 0.5-0.8kgs a week consistently. Although my weight loss has not been as extreme as others, myself and my treating dr are very happy with the incremental loss as it has meant my skin has more time to recover and my fatigue is nowhere near as bad 

I can eat almost anything although obviously only in small amounts. I generally choose protein and lower carb foods 99% of the time but have also enjoyed other foods like pasta, bread and rice because Iâ€™m very big on not restricting myself and restarting my binge eating issues. I can also eat small amounts of chocolate and ice cream but they make me feel a bit sick from the first bite so I donâ€™t usually want them. 

I can drink alcohol but my tolerance is low, I usually stick to ciders or pre mixes with 1.0 standard drinks now as cocktails knock me on my ass very quickly! 

My one vice that has returned? Coke no sugar over ice. Itâ€™s getting colder here now (winter is coming!) so Iâ€™m already noticing that the desire for a cold drink is declining and Iâ€™m reaching for the cordial/water mix more often. Iâ€™m hopeful that I can kick the habit altogether over winter."
Starting my journey,"Hello everyone! Iâ€™m new here, so thought Iâ€™d introduce myself. I am a 33f wife, mom, and high school teacher.  Currently I weigh 233 5â€™3.75â€ and my BMI is 40. I just started my WLS journey in January with the seminar at my local hospital. I picked my surgeon because he is awesome and he did my gall bladder removal last year. I just had my initial appointment with my surgeon, nurse practitioner, and financial specialist and decided to enroll in the program. I have pretty good insurance with Medical Mutual of Ohio and will be required to do 3 months of SDE. Iâ€™m hoping to have RNY this July.

Having strange pain 2 weeks post RNY,"Hi all. New poster but have been lurking here throughout my 9 month journey so far. I thought I had everything all covered for my post-surgery recovery (read all the books, following my doctor's instructions carefully, etc), but I've run into a snag. I started having a sharp pain on my side, near my left hip, for the past two days. It's worst when I try to bend or reach down, sitting, and when I'm lying in bed. I've got no fever or chest/shoulder pain, and my breathing and eating is fine. This almost feels like a torn muscle, if that makes sense. 

I've put in a call to my surgeon's office, but haven't heard back yet. Has anyone else here had a similar issue? I'm trying not to panic, but doctor google has me believing I'm ruptured and halfway in the grave!"
13 days,"So my sleeve surgery date is set for 7/2 and I'm doing my pre-op diet right now and I'm struggling hard. I know some of you have to do it for a month and I applaud ya'll because I'm on day 3/14 and all I want is a fucking sandwich or a burger right now. I'm finding that the unjury that I bought per the recommendation of the surgery team has a weird chemically taste that I can't quite get over (though I drink it anyhow) which I am going to guess is just the taste of the protein.

Tried the Santa Fe chili flavor last night and almost vomited it all back up. It just did NOT sit well with my stomach and I still had to have 8oz of milk and another shake 3 hours later so I ended up going to bed nauseous; I didn't even get in my final daily yogurt because I was worried it would be too much for my stomach.

I know this is just part of it, and that this is leading into starting my new life and all, but good god I find that I am just spending time in my basement because anytime I am upstairs my wife is either cooking something, or there's ads on TV for burgers or seafood or something and it's just making it worse.

Doesn't help that I've got a hunger headache behind my left eye that comes and goes every few hours. I'm keeping up on my fluids so that's not so bad but my body definitely is not thrilled with this change. On the positive I am curious to see where I am when the day arrives; I was 384 at my check-in last week so I'm curious to see where I end up.

I just needed to vent to people who would understand."
Photo Journaling Apps,"Looking for suggestions on any apps that chronicle changes in photos? Iâ€™ve taken about five â€œbeforeâ€ pictures that I want to keep track of as I go through my weight loss post op, but I have yet to find an app that does this.

I was just wondering if anyone on here has had a sleeve to rny revision? It terrifies me but dealing with this reflux everyday is so discouraging. I am able to control it with meds (PPI) but I don't want to be on them long term. Everyone is telling me I am too early to worry about it but I'm just scared. trying to become ok with the idea if this is what I need to do. Can anyone send any advice or words of encouragement ï¿½ï¿½
I am bad at memes but this felt really good.,
Additional Info?,"I have completed all my requirements for my surgery, but today I found out that my insurance has asked my clinic for more information. Has anyone had this occur? What does it mean? I couldn't get anyone on the phone at my clinic to ask, so I'm a bit concerned. I have Aetna insurance, if that helps."
Why were you denied.,"So Iâ€™m waiting for insurance approval still, and while I have my date Iâ€™m filled with anxiety that Iâ€™m going to be denied surgery. 

Iâ€™m curious to know what reasons you were denied surgery.  I completed all my insurance requirements, didnâ€™t gain any weight ( loss almost 20 lbs actually). But i still just so fearful, that I will be denied."
Wedding Dress Shopping and WLS,"Hi Everyone - Iâ€™m getting married in October of next year and I am planning WLS sometime this year.  I need to buy a wedding dress, but not knowing what my body will look like in 18 months is already stressing me out.  Now I donâ€™t need to buy a dress until a year from now, but 8 months is still a long time to wait between buying and wearing said dress.

Anyone else go through this?  What did you do?  Advice wanted!  Thanks everyone :)"
Insurance question (Cigna),"If 'surgeon A' sends in my info for pre-certification, and I get approved, can I do my wls with 'Surgeon B' instead without them resending it to Cigna? This is assuming I do all of the requirements for 'B'. "
Type 1 Diabetic having VSG tomorrow,Canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m having surgery tomorrow! Been a long 8 months to get here. Started a full liquid diet 5 days ago and clear liquid diet for today. Iâ€™ve been sipping all day and Iâ€™ve only been able to get in 212 calories! Iâ€™ve never had an issue getting calories in so this is a first for me lol. So far my sugars have been great but making me nervous being a little on the low side. Any other T1Ds on here that have had the VSG? I have the Medtronic 670G with the CGM btw!
Getting back on track,"So Iâ€™m 6 months out and 10 pounds away from 100lb loss...Iâ€™ve got about 40 left after that to hit my goal...but sugar. Iâ€™ve recently caved and had more processed/added sugar than the 5g limit my dietician recommended and itâ€™s become such an addiction and habit. How do yâ€™all get back on track after falling off? I really want to hit my goal before the end of the year and I want to be consistent with maintaining as well. Obviously one piece wonâ€™t hurt, but one piece a day has become so bad for me. Any advice is helpful!!"

Insurance questions,"6 month weight loss program insurance requirement question - Can a local body bootcamp fill that requirement ? I was apart of it for a year.

Also, my insurance provider (BCBSCA) says I need to have comorbidity with my BMI of 35 but I called and they didnt have a comprehensive list of comorbidities. I have a sleep apnea test coming up and morbidly, Im hoping I have it, and I currently have high cholesterol and asthma. Do these count? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks! Love reading the posts on here I'm so excited to get started and get the ball rolling asap. Im so unhappy at my current weight and just want to fast forward, which Im sure is normal. Ive been on a diet for most of my life and rarely lose much weight bc Im always hungry and eat too much. :( So now that Im not afraid of VSG surgery after doing all my research Im ready to roll lol.

Psych eval tomorrow!,"I am so nervous for my psych eval tomorrow. I was 100% honest on all the forms, and I donâ€™t think there will be issues, but Iâ€™m anxious just the same. Any anecdotes to make me feel better? Last minute advice?"
Looking for suggestions for upcoming surgery,"Iâ€™m currently waiting to hear back from insurance with my approval which has made this whole journey that more real. Iâ€™m trying to get things ready for my surgery. I was wondering what those who have had wls suggest as far as:
- an unflavored protein powder
- which vitamins and supplements youâ€™ve like the best
- best place youâ€™ve found recipes for all stages 
-is an abdominal binder necessary/helpful 
- those with kids, how long til you could care for them without someone elseâ€™s help 

This forum has honestly been so helpful and I really appreciate the great feedback and advice Iâ€™ve received."

Maybe should have started some of this before today but Iâ€™m a textbook procrastinator. ï¿½ï¿½"
Surgery consultation finally here.. advice needed!,"I have my surgery consultation scheduled for Friday morning and Iâ€™m like HOLY CRAP. I canâ€™t believe what Iâ€™ve worked for is finally here. Theyâ€™re scheduling two weeks out and Iâ€™m feeling every emotion. Iâ€™ve lost 30 lbs thus far by myself, and since I was cleared by the nutritionist 2 weeks ago, Iâ€™ve gained back a few pounds. Plus every-time Iâ€™ve weighed myself itâ€™s been inconsistent. I havenâ€™t stuck to my meals as much as I should and Iâ€™m definitely getting back on track but should I be worried about this weigh in? (Like I had a few white claws this week with my coworkers..) 
Also: what are the questions I should ask my surgeon? Iâ€™ve heard that he has really bad bedside mannerisms, but heâ€™s an amazingly skilled surgeon. Again, never met the guy so maybe heâ€™s great and Iâ€™m trying to go in open minded. I have a few already but Iâ€™d like to be really prepared since Iâ€™m freaking out. 

Thanks for any and all help!"
Do you still have your â€œfatâ€ clothes?,"I feel a little bit...jaded? Skeptical? I managed to lose a large amount of weight on my own a few years ago. I thought I was on the right path. I thought I had made a healthy change forever. Life was great. I got rid of my â€œfatâ€ clothes. 

Then I went to law school, which kicked me right in the teeth, weight-wise. The combination of constant studying, lack of exercise, eating fast/easy meals instead of cooking, eating out, and eating as a stress coping mechanism made me gain it all back plus an additional 50 lbs. After I graduated, my weight finally stabilized. But because I got rid of all my fat clothes, when I got fat again, I had to buy more fat clothes. Which was hella depressing and very expensive. 

So now Iâ€™m about 2 months away from completing Kaiserâ€™s 6 month wls program. I have lost a bit of weight, and my clothes are getting ever so slightly loose on me. I know that as this process goes on, Iâ€™ll get much thinner and the clothes will no longer fit.

So Iâ€™m wondering - how many of you straight up got rid of your fat clothes? How many of you have them stored in a closet somewhere? 

Iâ€™ve been burned before, so Iâ€™m thinking of just keeping everything. I want to believe in myself, but I also know that Iâ€™m human, and humans are imperfect, and if I fail, I donâ€™t want to have to buy all new fat clothes again. However, keeping all my fat clothes presents a different conundrum - I live in a VERY small apartment, and I barely have enough room for one set of clothes, let alone two sets of clothes."
"After you were approved, how long was it before your surgery date?","Iâ€™m wondering if I should lower my expectations. My 6 month program with kaiser ends at the end of November. I was hoping my surgery would fall sometime around the holidays, so that my boss wouldnâ€™t mind me taking off too much. But after seeing some posts here, Iâ€™m thinking itâ€™s unlikely that Iâ€™ll get a surgery date that within a month of being approved. 

So, Iâ€™m trying to figure out what is average/normal for most people. 

First, how long did it take to get approved after submitting your paperwork? 

Second, how long after getting approved was your surgery date?"
Protein and Calories Question,"Iâ€™m 7 weeks post-op from having the gastric sleeve.  Iâ€™m cleared to eat any foods now. But Iâ€™ve developed an aversion to alternative protein sources (shakes, bars, gels, powders etc). They make me violently ill without 10-15 minutes of ingesting them. So that takes a huge source of protein off the table. 

Right now Iâ€™m supposed to be eating 80 grams of protein and about 800 calories. I canâ€™t even come close.  My stomach can only hold 2-3 oz and itâ€™s typically closer to 2. Iâ€™m eating every 2-2.5 hours and itâ€™s all protein.  A typical day Iâ€™m getting in about 350-500 calories and 60 grams of protein. 

Realistically, what are you hitting daily? I read about people hitting 1200 calories and I canâ€™t even hit 500 most days. I feel like Iâ€™m failing. 

What are some of your favorite high protein meals. I currently eat a lot of tuna, salmon, ground turkey, chicken breast, shrimp, occasionally lean pork. 

Any ideas how to up my protein each day with such small portions? 

Iâ€™ve discussed with my nutritionist and am doing what sheâ€™s suggested but still canâ€™t hit my goals so I thought maybe so real life, practical advice may help."

Dehydration After Surgery,"I'm just about 4 months out from surgery and I'm still suffering from dehydration, but nothing as bad as when I first started. A few suggestions for people who can't seem to get the liquid down are taking magnesium and potassium supplements to help with cramping symptoms. I also suggest looking at an electrolyte supplement as it will help you retain a little more water. Before these I was pretty miserable and dealing with hand a foot spasms, feeling light-headed, etc. 

I'm still searching for the magic wand that will help me tolerate cold drinks better. Best I've had so far is sugar free crush mixed into water. I have to drink broth or tea most days to come close to my water goals."
7 Days Out,"I'm having my Mini-Gastric Bypass in a week. Starting my pre-op diet today. Pretty worried I won't keep to it, self control has never been my strong suit...obviously. I don't think it's going to shock anyone to learn that I tend to eat when I'm upset and, right now, I'm shitting bricks over this surgery. Have a feeling that a double cheeseburger is going to destroy this pre-op diet. So, I'm shamelessly begging you guys for encouragement to to gut it through this next week."
Problems with alcohol,"Okay, so I was sleeved roughly a year ago. I started having issues with severe depression and anxiety after that and when antidepressants didn't work I started drinking. I've never been a drinker in my entire adult life, couldn't stand the taste of alcohol in any way, but about 6 months ago I tried it. Brings us to now, I'm drinking basically every night. Seems like I've replaced food with alcohol and I'm not sure what to do about it. I've heard that it is not uncommon for people who have had wls to become alcohol dependent. Is there anyone in the same boat? Any advice?"
Goal Weight,"I started at 291 on Sept 21st , had surgery on Nov 26th and today im at 172 with a goal weight of 130. Its crazy to think my goal weight is only really 40 lbs away.

Facial Plastic Surgery after WLS?,"42M  
HW: 308  
CW: 292  
SD: 10/10/2019

I've lost substantial weight in the past (only to gain it back), and I notice that I always have a bit of a gaunt, or elongated look to my face afterwards. Now that I'm older, I suspect that this effect will be pronounced after losing weight from my upcoming VSG. What kinds of facial procedures can correct this look?"
One month post op and suddenly : HUNGRY,"Hey WLS, 
Just like the title says, Iâ€™m a month out of surgery, down 30 lbs so far, and out of the blue I am *famished*. Maybe Iâ€™m just not used to feeling hungry? But it feels like I go from 1 to 10 in terms of hunger signals and I feel like Iâ€™m eating more frequently. My meals are still very small - no more than 3 oz of solid food at a time - and my calorie intake is well under 750 per day. Is this normal?"
Insurance Question,"So my insurance excludes wls. Iâ€™m going ahead and self paying. I have a hernia though, so my question is will insurance deny paying for that if theyâ€™re done at the same time? I know each insurance is different, but just wanted general experiences."
Face-to-Face Friday (125+ lbs difference),

Thank you all,"I just wanted to say thanks for sharing your weight loss journey here.

"Aus 30yo Male full experience, cost &amp; stats, Gastric sleeve April 2019","Long time lurker of this sub.

Long time yo yo dieter always re-gaining more than I started at prior. I had paid for full insurance for this option for 5 years with this in the back of my mind.
I had read [this particular site](https://www.bariatric-surgery-source.com/weight-loss-surgery-australia.html) and a lot of others multiple times over.

FIRST THOUGHT
Finally looked at options spoke with my GP I have trusted for the longest time and who knows me very well. Suggested a surgeon and from there it flew by! 

PRE-OP DIET
I actually surprised myself with how I went with the 2 week pre-op diet, I think it was as I knew it was a means to an end. I was having protein slim shakes of various makes. I also used 3 weeks prior to get everything out of my system and go to a fine dining restaurant at a winery and made a big day of it as a final send off (really spent big and enjoyed myself (with my partner)) 

SURGERY
 11:30am admission and fasting from 7am. Waiting room till 2 shitting myself and second guessing my decision before finally getting into the operating room. Honestly, it was quite worrying when I went in here the big lights and the anesthesiologist just moving me around like crazy doing his thing until the next thing I remember is waking up feeling so unbelievably thirsty and pretty sick.
Incredible private room thank god and great nurses and doctors slept pretty well and minimal pain. Walked fine the next day and only slight pain when swallowing in my chest.

POST-OP DIET (day 5 at time of post)
Being fine on the post op diet just as others in here have mentioned struggling to get all the protein in but been pushing through knowing itâ€™s for the best. Also the swallowing of water with the pressure in the chest has improved.
Having 2 protein shakes a day, 1 or 2 bowls of soup, a bowl of jelly with ice-cream and a bottle of water

POST-OP RECOVERY
As mentioned had pain in my chest when swallowing but that is getting a lot better just need to remember no bigger mouthfuls of liquids than say 100ml at a time (usually skull water like a fish).
Bandages all of today wounds look great but have been so itchy.
Been walking and just incredibly active since surgery doing more things with my partner and walking with her a lot and really wanting to get more physical.

INSURANCE
There was some issues with my health insurance (Iâ€™m in Australia). 
2 days before surgery I got several calls from my insurer Frank Health who I have always loved for their ease of using the extras. The call was to say I was not covered but the issue was, I had called Frank a month earlier to check everything was all clear my surgeons nurse and eventually the surgeon themselves got involved and spoke to Frank and overturned the ruling.
Their issue was the cover changed as of April 1st and I had until the 31st of July to opt on any changes so technically I was covered thank god!

May 15 2017 - April 15 2019 -125lbs Roux-en-Y ï¿½ï¿½,
Any vegetarians/vegans?,"Hi! Iâ€™m new here, but had VSG back in December 2017. I am struggling to lose these last 20lbs and recently have kind of been over meat. I decided I was going to give going vegetarian, maybe morph into vegan, a try, but was curious if anyone had had any experiences doing so and how it worked(s) for you. Iâ€™ve been transitioning this week and have lost a couple of pounds, but just wanted some insight from others who also have tiny tummies and eat this way. TIA!"
Nothing tastes right today,"So it's father's day and my wife and daughters made me a great breakfast of stuff I could eat, and nothing was really appetizing. I made my way through the eggs, but the hash brown and sausage (smoked, which I LOVE) stayed on my plate because it didn't taste good.

Fast forward a few hours and my wife got some food from our favorite seafood spot, and the fish, shrimp, scallop and crab just really weren't hitting the spot either.

I know there are things that change, but everything in the same day?"
Approved and have a surgery date! Any tips?,"I (F, 35, HW: 299 CW: 268) have been lurking this subreddit for a while now while going through all of my prerequisites and it has given me a lot of information and support. I am so happy to say that my surgeonâ€™s office called me yesterday to say insurance approved me and my surgery is scheduled for June 25th. I am very nervous of the surgery and recovery (I am a SAHM with 3 young children) but I am so excited to really change my life for the better. Would love any great tips for surgery recovery!"
Shady question regarding non WLS doctor appointments.,"Iâ€™ve got a date in Mexico.  Since Iâ€™m self pay, Iâ€™m wondering how this plays out when I get back to the states.
Because of my weight, I have a few medical conditions.  I also, have pre-existing condition (not weight related), that requires lab work every 6 months.
Post -op, if they find, say, that Iâ€™m anemic will my insurance cover supplements or is this my out of pocket expense?
How have you handled appointments regarding medication changes, etc?
Obviously, surgical related complications/emergencies would not be covered...
FYI, I do not plan on keeping information from my doctors.  
"
CBD products for inflammation post-WLS?,"Since WLS folks are limited post-op for what medications we can take for pain/inflammation Iâ€™m exploring using CBD products but since theyâ€™re sometimes costly I wanted to ask if anyone had specific CBD brands or CBD products they recommend specifically for inflammation/pain (bonus if it helps anxiety, too). 


I canâ€™t smoke marijuana because of my job and Iâ€™ve  never had very good experience any time Iâ€™ve smoked anyway but the one or two times Iâ€™ve tried CBD have been positive."
Foolish choices,"I am two weeks out from vsg, and I tried to eat a few bites of something I shouldnâ€™t, and I paid for it for hours.  Donâ€™t be a dolt like me, go slow, be patient. You donâ€™t want to be in the middle of a four hour road trip and have to stop repeatedly because you are peeing out your butt.

If you think youâ€™re a super healer, you arenâ€™t.  If you think your body can handle it, it canâ€™t.

Other than my foolishness everything is great."
Summer 2017 and Summer 2019,So much inspiration inspired me to share. https://imgur.com/gallery/mX4VYOf
So Excited!!,"Just met with my surgeon today and went over some requirements. Since I have lost some weight already, he told me to lose 4 more pounds before surgery. He also recommended that I get the sleeve over RNY because of my age and my health(no major health issues besides being overweight) so I am going to go with the sleeve after all. So, just gotta hit goal weight, take a nutrition class and meet with the psychiatrist again before I can get a date set. Itâ€™s all moving so quickly! Iâ€™m super excited and cannot to get a surgery date!"
I had RNY on 8/14/18. I canâ€™t believe how much has change in such a short amount of time. Anyone who is questioning and hesitant about this decision- I strongly encourage you to talk to your doctor. For me- it was the best decision of my life! Iâ€™m so much more confident and feel so much better.,
7 Months Post VSG - Massive Stalls,"*Tl;dr: I've stalled for 6-7 weeks without changing anything about my diet or exercise. Still getting protein, and water goals daily but am starting to freak out (on top of having an unreasonable amount of real life stress happening at the moment) that this might be it. Any other long stallers have any insights or advice?*

  


**Firstly, I've always given the advice in here that stalls are normal and to be expected. Keep up the protein and water, stick to your diet plan and the weight will start coming off again.  I still live by this right up until today but after the last 6ish weeks and only losing 1.2 kilos, I've just about cracked it.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Stats: Female, 32yo, 5'7

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm 7 months post op and about 43 kgs down from my pre-surgery weight. My surgeon was happy when we met a month ago for the 6 month post-op appt and told me that I'm a *great success* and that I will probably level out weight wise now. That my current weight (91kgs/200lbs) is the best it'll probably get. I almost laughed in his face, after 6 months of watching the weight fall off me I was absolutely not going to be happy at this weight. I'm still massive and want at least another 10-15 kgs off me. He told me to not expect miracles and to just keep eating as I do and more weight will come off but much slower now. I left feeling like he was so wrong and he could bite it... I'd be my dream 75 kgs within 2 months.... 

but **POOF!**

Like magic, without changes to my exercise or food plans (4 gym days a week and 1000-1200 cals a day) my weight loss has completely screeched to a halt since that meeting. 

I know stalls are normal but I have changed literally nothing and every single week my weight pretty much stays the same. I've spoken to my dietitian who again recommended I eat a *minimum* 1200 cals a day but it's not working (keeping in mind that I was eating these same cals before this massive stall so I know it's an appropriate goal) and I'm about to go crazy. I did NOT sacrifice my stomach for the rest of my life so that I could still be this obese!

I have been under a crazy amount of pressure lately real life wise and wonder if that has something to do with my bodies complete shutdown/refusal to let go of any more weight. 

I've also heard/read that maybe I'm not eating enough? Maybe I exercise too much for the amount I eat?

Or maybe it's the total opposite and I need to drop back to 900 cals a day again?

Regardless, I need advice from people who've had long, long, unmovable and 'unprovoked' stalls. I'm crushed to think that this might be it... I'm only 7 months post op and I've worked so hard to get here. This cant be it... "
Stomach binders?,"I had RNY last week and Iâ€™m feeling pretty good overall, except for the fact that I canâ€™t lay on my side.  Iâ€™ve heard people recommend stomach binders, anyone have experience wearing one for this reason?  Can you recommend a brand/type that might work for me, Iâ€™m 6â€™2 440lbs so I want to make sure I get one that isnâ€™t too small."

Part 2 of my blog - my story so far,
Insurance Approved My Surgery!,"After six long months of waiting, repetitive appointments with my family doctor (""yep, still fat! See you next month..."")  an upper GI swallow study, psychological assessment, tons of lab work, and three meetings with the nutritionist, my bariatric doctor's office submitted my case to my insurer and I'm APPROVED for VSG. Surgery scheduled for July 16th. If anyone is considering wls and has Aetna, I'm happy to answer any questions about my process."
Help,"I am scheduled for vsg on 06/19/19 and I couldn't be more terrified.  I really just want to call and cancel, but I would be letting my wife and kids down.  I know I need this surgery but I just feel bad.  I am angry that I let myself get into this mess.  I'm angry that I can't just be normal and eat normal portions.  I am scared that life will never be normal again.  Sorry for the rant, I am just feeling very very broken right now."
Wish I had taken more before pictures of just my face. Found this one on my work badge though,
NSFail: SW 227 CW 178 Sleeved 7/31,"I was feeling pretty good at nearly 50 lbs lost since I started my journey.  So I decided to go to this super nice clothing boutique and see what I had to look forward to.  
A salesperson greeted me.  After a pause she asked if I was shopping for a gift or for someone else.  I was flustered, stuttered a bit, and mumbled something about being on a diet and promising that I'lllose more weight.  Thankfully, a more senior  sales associate came over and simply said that if I'd like to try anything on to let her know, and she show me to a dressing room.

Uggggghhhh...  it was fairly humiliating, but I'm just going to write it off and focus on the task at hand."
Started modified pre-surgery diet,"Yesterday I started a modified version of the pre-surgery diet. My surgeon wants me to lose about 17 lbs, but since I have type one diabetes I canâ€™t be on a standard two week pre-surgery diet, since that purposefully sends people into ketosis, and ketosis for type ones leads to diabetic ketoacidosis, which can be deadly. Iâ€™m doing three protein shakes a day that have 17 grams of carb, and two snacks with 15 grams of carbs for a total of about 81 grams of carbs a day, 60 grams of protein, and around 800 calories. I had ketones in my urine yesterday when I waited too long into the day to eat all my food, but Iâ€™m good so far today, so fingers crossed!"
After pre-gym breakfast ideas for early morning,"I used to work out while fasted and then eat afterwards but now Iâ€™m doing heavy weights Iâ€™m finding thatâ€™s not working for me. My workouts are early (5:30am) so Iâ€™m after suggestions on what other people with the sleeve eat on the way to the gym for brekkie?

I canâ€™t eat lunch until 3pm most days so usually try to have a second breakfast/snack around 9:30am."
Post-Op Birth Control,"Hey all,

I had my pre-op appointment on Monday and am scheduled for a VSG on May 7th. In my pre-op appointment, the PA said I would need to double up on birth control, which sounded odd to me because I have an IUD (Mirena) and everywhere else I've read that is the recommended route to go.  I'm aware that fertility increases with weight loss, but one of the reasons I like my IUD is that it's been super effective.  I got pregnant within 3 months of taking the thing out with my two kids.  Seems like overkill to use condoms on top of something that is 99.9% effective at preventing pregnancy.  Thoughts?"
Cravings 4 days post op,"But its weird, preop I was craving pizza and fried chicken but now all I want is steamed brocolli. My mouth is watering over the thought of brocolli. What is wrong with me? Lol.

2 Weeks out (VSG) - Unexpected Fluid in take???,"So I am two weeks out from VSG. I was told drinking water would be a problem and I'd struggle to get the neccessary amount in. 

Thaaaats not a problem for me. About 5 days out I noticed I could drink water almost endlessly without issue. Is this normal? I tried calling my doc and they are still trying to catch up from the holiday to actually call me back. So I thought I'd ask you all. 

I mean, I still can't eat much (eventhough I think its more than I should be able to). Should I be concerned about this water thing? I feel great, losing weight... but I have no issues drinking a crud ton of water.

"Scale, why you gotta be so inconsistent?","Hello hello, 

So today I have what I hope is my final meeting with my nutritionist pre-op and she and I set a goal for me to be 539 today. I was 555 when I saw her last. I have been down to 536 at some points during this month and have seen a lot of fluctuations regarding my weight. I know you shouldnâ€™t weigh yourself everyday and when you do be consistent about timing, what youâ€™re wearing etc. (I wait til before my shower and Iâ€™m nakey :) ) 

I have a scale I got on amazon that goes up to 700lbs which I paid a decent amount for. The scale is on my bedroom floor on wood, hasnâ€™t moved since Iâ€™ve gotten it about a month ago and I am just frustrated bc I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll hit that number on the scale in the office today. Possibly on my scale yes but there could be a +\- of 5-6 lbs difference. 

On the plus side, itâ€™s been 5 weeks since Iâ€™ve seen her and out of those 5 weeks, not consistently Iâ€™ve only skipped 7 days of logging my meals and have exercised for 40 minutes or more (treading water) everyday only missing 3 days! 

Sheâ€™s very intimidating so thatâ€™s why I think Iâ€™m so nervous. I get it though, sheâ€™s just doing her job. Also, I have a lot of shit going on thatâ€™s stressful as my dad is very sick and me and my mom are busting our asses to take care of him, which has led to some not so good choices. Iâ€™m just really anxious about my meeting today so cheer me up lol."

Hair problems,So Iâ€™m 2.5 years out from surgery and really struggling with my hair. I take vitamins every day and work to get my protein in but it still looks awful and patchy. I have been wearing extensions but my friend who normally put them in has moved away and itâ€™s super expensive to have a salon do maintenance on them ($800 average in my area). I was considering cutting my hair super short (Iâ€™m talking buzz cut) and starting to wear wigs. Does anyone have any advice?
Brown bag lunches,"All, what are some of your go to easy brown bag lunches to take to the office?   (Iâ€™m preop, surgery in November.  Trying to eat like I will be eating after recovery/rest of life)

Subdermal scar tissue and other issues.,So I had the Vsg surgery 1year ago. I've lost all my and my doctors goal weight and am now maintaining. I've actually been doing very well with the psychological and physical adjustments. I just have a couple issues. 1: the incision were the removed portion of the stomach was taken got infected and refused to heal for the longest time but finally it did. Now my surgeon says it looks like I've developed a boil at a different location. The second issue is the scar tissue at that same incision spot as well as beneath the skin. Has anyone else dealt with these issues? My surgeon is going to put me back on antibiotics but I'm not sure if there's anything else I can do to take care of my new body.

Tattoos after weight loss?,"I have many tattoos I want to get that I've been waiting on until I lost weight. I didnt want to get a tattoo on my thigh and then lose a ton of weight and have it be ruined.  

Now, though, I'm starting to worry about the loose skin seriously hindering it. Obviously I wont be able to get tattoos on areas with big areas of loose skin. But what if most areas of my body are vaguely loose and it's too difficult to tattoo because of shifting and stuff? Is that a thing?"

4 days post op (VSG) am I doing too much?,Just looking for some peace of mind or maybe a course correction! I started full liquids yesterday and was able to hit my water goal without really trying and my protein goal. I had 10 oz of fat free fair life milk and a scoop of protein powder in the morning and then 8oz of tomato soup with some protein powder. All of that without too much discomfort and not really feeling full. Today I had the same protein shake and then a cup of cream of chicken soup with protein powder. Iâ€™m nursing my last bit of my water goal and some protein water mixed in. Iâ€™m realizing now maybe I wonâ€™t have super big overwhelming signs of being full and now Iâ€™m freaking out that I might stretched my pouch out. Anybody else have a similar experience? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

I got approved today! Waiting on the call to setup my final appointments and surgery date. I am so excited!,"When I got the call my heart dropped because I was fearing the worst. My doctors office told me it would be a very long time before I would get an answer(45 days). I have 2 insurances to go through but my primary doesnâ€™t cover wls at all. I was told the pre-authorization would have to go through my primary insurance first BCBS and it would take 30 days. Once that came back denied then we can submit to my secondary insurance Aetna. It turns out that was totally wrong there was no need to submit to my primary since itâ€™s an exclusion. I ended up getting a denial letter from BCBS which we sent to Aetna. I donâ€™t know if it was just luck or the denial letter (was a struggle to get in the first place), but my approval came back so quick from Aetna. It was submitted Friday and I got the call today. I was so excited I burst into tears. This whole process is going so quickly for me and I canâ€™t wait to start this next step."

Question about Body Building and Vitamins after wls,"Hello i had a 2 questions about life after wls?

1. is it possible to body build/ gain a huge amount of muscle(bulk up) years after surgery(maybe like 2 years).
2. when it comes to gastric sleeve does one have to take vitamins for the rest of his life, or is it just a temporary thing.

These two things are a main concern to me , i would love to lose my weight but i dont want to be stuck being skinny. Im hoping someone could speak on their experience were they were able to build a body after surgery and not just stay skinny. "
Getting different info from NP and Dietitian grrrr.,"Just like the title says, last month, I had my initial appointment with my surgeon and the NP there told me that at my current weight of 233 and BMI of 40ish I was allowed to lose as much weight as I want before surgery as long as I donâ€™t go below a BMI of 35 even though I donâ€™t have any comorbidities.  Fast forward to this afternoon at the dietitian for my first D&amp;E appointment and he tells me that is wrong. According to him, it has pretty much been set in stone since 1992 that if you have no comorbities, you must stay about 40 BMI for all of the D&amp;E appointments. He did ask me for the persons name who told me the incorrect information and said he was going to nicely handle it so that other people wonâ€™t be getting the wrong info in the future. This just made me kind of worried and frustrated. What if I go through the next few months of preparing for the surgery only to find out that I was misinformed about something else and canâ€™t have surgery. Anyway, I hope no one else is having this problem! "

Iâ€™m 1 week into my Preop diet and only -3lbs down.,My doctor has ordered me to do a OPTIFAST diet which is 5 shakes a day for two weeks before my surgery. They stated I HAVE to be down -17lbs in two weeks in order to have my surgery on June 25th. Failure to loose -17lbs from OPTICAST will result in the surgery being rescheduled. I am following this diet to a T and only lost -3lbs in a week. There is no way I can hit -17lbs by next Monday. Has anyone had to lose this much weight in 2 weeks? Iâ€™m so worried because this date aligns perfectly with my work schedule and I canâ€™t reschedule a date until August.

Advice to get back on track,"Hi friends!

I had RNY 6 months ago and am down 100 pounds (woo!). I still have about 40 pounds to go. This past month has been rough due to work obligations and travel and I have found something interesting about myself. When I can keep in a routine, Iâ€™m unstoppable. However, as soon as that routine is disrupted (going out of town, getting sick and missing a workout, missing lunch due to work obligations, etc, you know, life in general), it will take me several days to get back on track. So for example, I went out of town for a weekâ€™s vacation and allowed myself to stop tracking (still drank as much water as possible and still prioritized protein). Iâ€™ve been back home for two days and just canâ€™t get into the swing of things and when I weighed myself this morning, I was up two pounds. 

Any tips on how to not get completely derailed by lifeâ€™s complications and how to get back into your routine when it does? Iâ€™m trying not to beat myself up, because I know this is a process and I need to learn these lessons to be successful long term. But any advice would be appreciated."
Pre-op weightloss,"Hello, 

I started my surgery prep in May starting at 573. Currently I am at about 555. I lost 13lbs in three weeks just trying to reduce my fast food consumption, gained back 6 of that and then here we are three weeks later down a total of 18. 

I just have to ask.. am I doing okay? Iâ€™m really trying so hard to follow my nutritionists plans but I am still struggling. Hoping for a little bit of encouragement. Sorry if it seems like Iâ€™m fishing for compliments."
1 month post op food ideas,I need help with food ideas.  I can't eat artificial sugar products - the aftertaste is too much.

Can't keep any bariatric vitamins down,"So I can't keep ANY bariatric multivitamin down. I either throw up immediately or throw up in 30 minutes.

I   have no issue taking a B complex, B12, Vitamin D, Fish oil, Calcium citrate, Iron, etc individually. But  I've had no luck with any bariatric vitamin. I've tried the capsules, tried emptying them into food(still puked), tried chewables(still puked).   So I am temporarily taking a gummy multivitamin at just double the dose until I can afford to buy another bariatric multivitamin.

Anyone have these issues? Can you recommend a bariatric vitamin that might work for more sensitive stomachs? I can't afford to waste much more money on these!"
2 years out... need some motivation.,"I have fallen off the wagon HARD.

Flight home after surgery abroad,"I've been researching going to mx for surgery but so far I havent found any info on flying home esp for people traveling solo. I am specifically worried about luggage.

 I have a small bag that fits under the seat so I wouldnt have to lift it to the overhead bin, but it's a backpack/satchel style so I would have to carry it. Alternatively, I have a larger rolling suitcase, but I'm worried about lifting into the overhead bin, or lifting it off the carousel if I check it.  There are no direct flights from my town to my surgery location so I would prefer to carry on my bags so they dont get lost.

  I'm also worried about flying with the fatigue so many people have mentioned esp since I will have to catch a connecting flight.  Should I be worried that I am traveling alone?  I am looking at endobariatric and they only keep you for 3-4 nights but most info I've read said to avoid lifting/carrying things for 2+ weeks.

 I would appreciate anyone sharing their stories or tips on how to deal with the flight home. Thanks"

Starting my journey.,"Hello! 

Iâ€™ve been lurking for awhile, and Iâ€™ve recently taken the first steps to a VSG. The stories Iâ€™ve read here both positive and negative are a major source of inspiration for me. Iâ€™ve met with my surgeon, and I begin my six month insurance/surgical requirements in June. Iâ€™m 33F, and Iâ€™ve got a child and a husband who are a huge part of why Iâ€™m taking these steps. Obesity is common in my family, as are heart disease, insulin resistance/diabetes, and other â€œwesternâ€ illnesses. Iâ€™ve been a diagnosed T2 diabetic for almost a decade, and while itâ€™s been well controlled, I know that itâ€™s going to get harder to manage as I get older.

Iâ€™ve known several people who have had WLS, with both excellent outcomes and with grave ones; Iâ€™m definitely scared, but Iâ€™m also excited. My surgeon is well liked, and has a remarkable record for excellent WLS outcomes. Iâ€™d be lying if I said I was ready to go under the knife tomorrow; I know Iâ€™ve got a long road ahead of me. But I know in my heart that this is a tool that I need. Iâ€™ve gained and lost the same 50 pounds every year for as long as I can remember; Iâ€™ve tried just about every diet and lifestyle change imaginable much like many of you. And every time I swear that â€œthis is itâ€. I canâ€™t say for sure whether WLS will be the last thing for me or not. But I need to try. And I need to succeed. 

So, hello. I hope to be here a year from now with a set of fabulous progress pics, and a renewed lease on life."

Need advice from people that worked a manual labor job after WLS.,"So I am almost 8 weeks post op vsg and last week I got a new job ar goodwill.

I unload and load heavy equipment and furniture all day long, pull heavy double stacked pallets of stuff, etc.  I am drinking around 2 gallons of water on my 9 hour shift and only urinating 3 times or so, so most of it is lost in sweat.


The biggest problem I have is food! I can only eat around 1200 calories per day, 1500 at the absolute tops and thats eating a lot of proccessed crap.  I am running on empty energy wise about 3 to 4 hours into my shift. I just hit an absolute wall and have no energy. The one thing that seems to work is eating sugary stuff. Like a candy bar. Immediate return of energy after that. But I hate eating proccessed crap. Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do? 

I am 29 years old, 5'11, 350 pounds. Im estimating that I am in at least a 3500 calorie deficit every day as my weight loss has averaged 1 pound per day, every day since starting this job. 

Any tips from people with similar jobs would be appreciated!"
Some thoughts on stalls: a little update,"Previous thread [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/wls/comments/bc6vxv/some_thoughts_on_stalls/).

I've been staying off the scale this week to prevent frustration, but this morning was one of my regularly-scheduled weigh-ins, so up we go. My weight... is maybe down incrementally since a few days ago, but still a couple of pounds above my recent low. So there's some sign of progress, but I'm not sure if I count this stall as having broken yet. 

Then I got out the tape measure, and... again, maybe incremental progress, but still about the same as it has been. 

Body fat % (as measured by my scale) hasn't changed one whit. 

In despair, I pulled some clothes out of the closet just to see if *anything* was different. The last time I tried some of these on was about a month ago, when my weight wasn't more than 3-4 pounds higher than it is today. These also constitute the smallest clothes I own. One shirt in particular, a black silk button-down... I've been chasing this shirt for 20 years, hoping that someday I'd fit into it. (I have never actually fit into it since I got it, but I love it, so I've kept it.)

The first shirt... fit. Like, I could wear it to work without feeling self-conscious. A month ago it did not, but today it did. Huh. Weird. 

The second shirt was actually *kind of big.* 

I was utterly baffled -- how could something fit differently when I've lost neither weight nor any significant volume? -- but I pressed on, and pulled out the Holy Grail, black silk button-down. 

Y'all... it fit. It has *never* not been tight around the hips, but today it hung free. Only just, mind you, but still... it went all the way around my hips, with no pressure whatsoever on that bottom button. It even covered my belly, like, all the way. 

Seriously, 20 years! I was living in London when I got that shirt; since then I've lived in Memphis, Los Angeles, Memphis again, Portland, OR, Central MA and now Vermont, dragging this thing along with me in the hopes that eventually I might be able to wear it like a normal person. And today was finally the day that I tried it and it fit. 

So /u/jhope71, it looks like you were right. I don't understand how this works, but even while I'm stalled out, something is still changing."
Post op questions...,Helllooo from the other side! Iâ€™m three days post op and was wondering when I should expect my insides to stop feeling weird all the time? Outside of eating/drinking too much I mean.  It constantly feels like thereâ€™s something inside of my chest and a dull ache like I ran too much right above my incisions. Follow up edit question: these are Not signs of drinking too fast right? 
Have you increased calorie intake to allow for activity?,"Hi all, Iâ€™m 5 months post-op, still eating at around 800 calories (plus/minus 100 cals each day but an average of 800), 60 oz water, and 50-60 G protein. Iâ€™m not keto or anything specifically low carb, but I avoid sugar and white bread/pasta/rice.  Things have been mostly smooth sailing since surgery, health wise. 

The past couple of weeks Iâ€™ve felt really run down, tired, and slightly nauseated pretty much all day. I chalked it up to a virus and maybe dehydration from a lot of traveling, but weirdly Iâ€™m also like ravenously hungry after months of having basically no appetite. 

Iâ€™ve never tracked or eaten back my calories burned through exercise, but decided to start tracking them just to see how much I was burning, and it seems like I might be burning more calories though exercise than Iâ€™m taking in. Like today, I did yard work for two hours, i took a 1.5 mile walk pushing a stroller and carried two little kids around at the park, and then I taught two hour long dance classes where I danced along with my students most of the time.  When I tallied it all up, I had burned approximately 900 calories. I probably have days similar to this 3-4 times a week, and on â€œrestâ€ days I either do a kettlebell workout or go for a 3 mile walk/jog. 

Do I feel crappy because Iâ€™m overdoing it?  Should I try to take in more than 800 calories or am I thinking about this whole intake/output thing wrong and should stick with whatâ€™s working for weight loss? Iâ€™m just not sure I can think of what else it might be thatâ€™s suddenly made me feel so crappy except hormone shedding. 

If you have any insight or advice, Iâ€™d appreciate it especially if youâ€™ve made diet or calorie modifications due to wanting to get in shape or train for something athletic."
Looking for some general feedback,"I'm currently in the pre contemplation phase in determining if WLS is right for me. My current job involves standing/walking for about 80% of the time. I work in dialysis. This means in addition to being very busy and not having quick access to water (you can't drink on the unit, only break room), we also have to wear these waterproof gowns to protect from blood exposure. These things do not breath and you sweat a lot. I feel like I go home mildly dehydrated everyday. Is it even possible to continue a job like this after WLS. I feel like I'd be hospitalized quite a bit for dehydration. In your opinion, do you think a job like this would just need a longer recovery before returning or would I need to change jobs completely. Thanks for any input."
First one on one,"I meet with the nutritionist today for a 1-1 meeting. Iâ€™m really nervous. following the diet has been hard, I feel like I wasnâ€™t given enough guidelines to follow. I had three goals to meet, 1. Stop the fast food, eat lean meats and cut out carbonated beverages. Also, keep a food journal. 

I have reduced my fast food intake a lot but occasionally the cravings are too strong and Iâ€™ve gotten some. I of course regret it when Iâ€™m writing it down. 

I have been eating leaner meats, and once I cut fast food I will be done with that crap.

I havenâ€™t had as many carbonated drinks. I think like maybe 3 or 4 the entire time Iâ€™ve been trying not to drink them. 

The fast food is the worst. I literally crave it all the time. I will call a friend on the way home from work so I donâ€™t get anything that would allow me to stop and get food. 

I think Iâ€™m overeating even when I go to the healthy stuff. This needs tweaking. 

I have however positively learned a lesson: 

Life happens. There will always be a birthday or a staff luncheon or a sick parent and food will be there. Just cus itâ€™s there doesnâ€™t mean I have to eat it. (Now I know it, need to follow it!) 

My nutritionist seems a little harsh and Iâ€™m afraid shes not gunna be happy. Idk. 

Thanks for listening."
Damn Stall,"Lost 40 pounds in 2 weeks, pretty intense. Then stalled, thought I'd go longer than 2 weeks before stalling out, but that's my luck. I've been stalled for a week and a half now and I'm trying to keep it all in perspective, but it ain't easy. 

How long have you guy's stalls lasted?"
Ab workouts?,"How long after surgery were you able to comfortably do ab workouts?

Right now I workout an average of 1-1.5 hours a day 3-5 days a week. I exercised up until a week before surgery same amount if not less. I have no pain but still feel a ""pinch"" when doing certain exercises.

"Wakeup call, 6 months post OP","Hello guys, I have a couple of questions.. Im on mobile so ill try to get straight to the point. 

I'm 6months post OP. Went from 125kg to 76kg. Went on the scale today and weighed 82kg. I sadly gained 6kg. 

I did expect to gain weight since I been eating bad foods lately and havent been tracking my calories since post op. This was a wakeup call for me. 

I want to start tracking my calories but im not sure what app to use that supports Dutch Language. 

I dont know how much calories I need since im 6months out and the calories I need now when will I have to up my calories again? 

I went to a regular doc (not specified in wls) and told her I had surgery etc. And said I ate around 1000 - 1200calories a day. She looked at me shocksd and told me to eat 2000 calories a day??? 
Could you guys tell me how much protein, carbs, fats I need a day and how long ill need to follow that one till I have to up my calories again."
"History and physical done, now to the checklist","Thanks everyone for your comments regarding my embarrassment. It definitely went away as soon as I was in the appointment. Now Iâ€™m worried about my A1C and THS tests but Iâ€™m hoping theyâ€™re okay. (Hadnâ€™t been to
My PCP in yearsâ€” never liked them or had good experience.) Iâ€™m excited/nervous? I have my nutrition seminar next week. I just donâ€™t want anything to hold me up. When doing the history they asked about diabetes and high BP and I said noâ€” because honestly I donâ€™t know? Should I feel guilty? I know my blood work will show the writing on the wall. Just hoping itâ€™s all good. 

I guess Iâ€™m kinda using this as a journal. Hope thatâ€™s okay."
11 weeks post op RNY- Eating Sucks,"The first month of my recovery from RNY went really well but I haven't really been able to progress past the soft foods stage. Even just a few bites of well-chewed meat (I've tried chicken, ground turkey, ground beef, braised pork) makes me really nauseous and I end up throwing it up. I'm in a real funk still just eating the same old foods such as yogurt and cottage cheese. I'd really appreciate hearing from folks where it got easier with time. I'm just feeling really down and need to know it's not going to be like this forever!

edit to make words make more sense"
How long after wls did your hair start to grow out again?,"I am 1 month post op in 3 days and although I havenâ€™t started losing hair yet, I know itâ€™s inevitable and I was just curious at what point did your hair start to grow out? Also when it does grow back out does it ever return to its original thickness pre op?"
"Home, reckon I got off light","Sleeved in Australia on 31 July, came home Saturday morning.  I was first cab off the rank; I've got an underlying heart issue (one of the reasons for the sleeve is to take a load off my heart while the meds do their thing), and my surgeon wanted the anaesthetist fresh and bubbly.

Surgery was around 730am, I was awake at 12.  Went for a couple of short walks that afternoon, but turned in early.  I stayed in hospital for three nights - two days nil by mouth (just ice chips), fluid diet started day three, IV fluids the whole time (about a litre every eight hours).  Day two I was stiff and a bit groggy, day three I was fine, by Saturday morning I was jumping to get home.

I've had no pain - like, zero.  They gave me IV Panadol (acetaminophen for my American cousins), but that was it, and I haven't taken any since getting home.  No gas.  No bloating.  No bowel issues.  Some very, very mild nausea immediately post-op but suspect this was more from having to sleep on my back with a CPAP mask and post-nasal drip and was gone by day three.  No vomiting, though I did gag / cough up some stuff once during the night - same reason.  (I can now sleep on my back fine for the first time in as long as I can remember - it's super weird.)

First day on fluids it took me most of the morning to get through 4 oz of apple juice; Sunday I got up to a litre (a bit over a quart); yesterday I got to 1.7 litres; today I've hit the litre mark by lunch time.

My tastes have changed markedly.  Whey protein isolate shakes are now sickly sweet and a chore to get down (easier today though).  I'm enjoying homemade bone broths fortified with collagen peptide powder and soluble fibre.  The first one was just a rotisserie chicken halved, stuffing removed, thrown in a couple of quarts of water with some cilantro, ginger slices, garlic and sliced onion, simmered for a couple of hours then strained.  With the collagen and fibre it's light but has a great mouthfeel and is deeply savoury which hits the spot.  

Made a batch of pho stock this morning (roasted beef bones, charred onion and ginger, star anise, cinnamon, pepper, dried shrimp, some other bits and pieces), and have a Moroccan lamb broth on now (same deal but with lamb bones, bay leaves, parsley, different spices; I'll freshen it up with some lemon).  This afternoon it'll be shiitake / bonito dashi, and that should set me up for a while.  I've ordered some clear / unflavoured WPI powder so I can add that to the stocks to get complete protein and reduce my reliance on sweet shakes.  At the moment I'm hitting 100g of protein per day without much drama - three WPI shakes each at 30g each, another 15-30g from collagen in broth.

The rest of the time I'm sipping diluted fruit / vege juice (apple and V8 Purple Power combined is pretty good - not too sweet, getting some veg in).  Slowly building up my walking (about to head to the local cafe for a small skim flat white).  Not a huge fan of having to give my self anti-clotting clexane injections for 10 days but it's over in a second and much better than the alternative.

So, feeling very lucky overall.  A fantastic surgical team helps, obviously, but it seems like there are a lot of small, non-surgical things that can go wrong that can make recovery a lot less pleasant.  Feeling very grateful to have dodged them so far."
Any one get their surgery in Canada ? What was the cost and wait time ?,"I live in Calgary, AB but i'm willing to travel within Canada. I'm just having a hard time finding the cost for either of the main 3 procedures. I thought someone who has had the procedure could tell me what they paid. Also did it take you a long time to get in for surgery ? 

Thank you."
My idea wedding cake. Thanks Costco!,
Exercise after surgery,"I exercise very lightly at the moment due to pain and nausea from gastroparesis, but Iâ€™m hoping I will be able to exercise more after the surgery. How long did it take you after surgery to start exercising? What tools (apps, Fitbit, gym) helped you the most?"
"Post gastric sleeve... random problems again, is it my fault?","Hi there, 

I was sleeved 01/02/2019 and aside from the first month of recovery, which is bad for everyone, I've had very few issues with my sleeve. I was able to move on to solids very fast, and quickly came to a new 'normal'.

However within the past couple weeks, it's almost as if I've back tracked! For example, any food at all is bothering me, and feeling not pleasant going down, including protein drinks. A few days ago was the first time in a while food couldn't make it to the tummy and I had to vomit it up. Also back to having frequent diarrhea. I'm coming up on month 3 of my journey, so I'm a little shook that things are backsliding a bit.

 I know that after any surgery you can't expect things to be smooth sailing. But I'm wondering if anything is my fault? If anything I'd like to learn and prevent problems in the future. 
Has anyone else had this happen? Is this relatively common? Or might I be overlooking certain things, do you have any adivice or things to look out for? Things that may cause this? Thank you for reading!"
Abdominal ultrasound,"I have my abdominal ultrasound Wednesday. What should I expect? The doctor said I have a hernia, will they repair it during my RNY?"

Using Your Flex Spending Account After Surgery,"Hi all,

I haven't seen any posts about this so I thought I'd share my experience in case it could help others.  

Right before surgery I learned that bariatric supplements, personal trainer fees and some fitness classes/programs are covered by a Flex Spending plan as long as your surgeon provides you with a Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN).   I don't know if that applies to all FSA plans but it's worth checking out. 

The tax savings isn't huge, but the convenience of spreading the cost of those expenses evenly over the entire year is what I find most valuable.   It's just one more tool in my arsenal to keep me on track because I've already committed to the expense and can't use the ""I can't afford it"" excuse especially when it comes to personal training sessions and classes.

I now do boot camp twice a week and personal training once a week.  I am 4 months post op (loop duodenal switch), down 77 pounds and feeling fantastic. "
Questions on extra skin removal,"So my girlfriend had sleeve surgery a few years ago before I met her.  She's lost a ton of weight, and completely turned her life around.  She's a yoga instructor now and in amazing shape.  The problem is all the extra skin.  It messes with her all the time.  She keeps thinking she's fat because of it, that she has to keep working out an unreasonable amount.  Or that she'll never actually ""look thin"" even though she's lost so much weight.

It breaks my heart, and I know it's really terrible for her own self image.  

Her insurance doesn't cover the skin removal, and even if it did it terrifies her.  She's heard that it hurts more, takes way longer to recover, and her initial sleeve surgery had all kinds of complications to begin with.  Part of me wants to get it for her as a gift, but she doesn't want it if it means she can't fork for a few months or something.

So I guess I'm trying to find out what the deal is.  How expensive is it, is it really that bad recovery wise?  Is there anything besides assuring her I love her and I know it's just skin I should be doing to help her be OK with it?  I really think it would do wonders for her self image to get it done."
Headcold after surgery.,"So I've had the sniffles for a few days. Last night it turned into a full blown cold with snot filled sinuses. I'm staying on top of my meds, but still sneezing occasionally and it KILLS my abdomen. 

Has anyone else had this issue? What can I do to reduce the pain?"
Had my 1st consultation today!,"Im 33 F, 5'10ish and weigh 273.


Technically it's my 2nd 1st, I started the process late last year, then life happened and I didnt follow through with the nutrition meetings. I did do the endoscopy though so thats one less thing I have to do. My insurance requires 6 consecutive months of nutrition meetings, since I have to travel 2 hours for appointments and surgery I was able to schedule a couple of those through phone calls.

I'm going with the sleeve which seems so much less scary than doing the bypass. I've never had surgery for anything so I'm already very nervous and scared. Are there any women out there with stats similar to mine who could share some progress for motivation?"
Pity Party in Aisle 6 (Shingles!?),"So Iâ€™ve been having pain in my arm since surgery. This morning I woke up with a red rash up my arm and blisters. 

Doc thinks I have shingles! 

Iâ€™m 9 days post-VSG and now have shingles! WTF


So I just had a cleansing ugly cry...the lab tech gave me a big hug. I needed that. 

Now Iâ€™m waiting on the pharmacist and doctor to work out my medicine...she swore there wasnâ€™t a liquid antiviral...pharmacist said there is one...FML"
"To everything (stall, stall, stall)...There is a season (stall, stall, stall)","Alright. So stats:
Started my WLS 4-6 month program 06/18/18 at 5â€™6â€ 329lb. (Thank the gods for this program by the way. Iâ€™m so happy i had this training before diving into this life change. No matter how frustrating waiting was, the program was so incredibly helpful)

Surgery wasnâ€™t until 12/13/18 because of delays due to a series of insurance struggles and appeals processes. 
288lb at time of RNY surgery. 

Iâ€™ve been stuck at 268lb since January 2nd. Iâ€™ve seen my dr and nutritionist twice since then for check ins and they assured me this stall is perfectly normal and Iâ€™m doing great. 
I have alarms for water and for protein. Iâ€™m getting between 60-90oz water a day (the low end is on days i work, since i tattoo itâ€™s sometimes difficult to make such frequent stops to unglove and take a drink and Iâ€™m very strict about cross-contamination). I usually have 1 scrambled egg OR a 150g Greek yogurt for breakfast. A couple hours later i have a premier protein shake. Lunch is usually a yogurt or 2 mozzarella snack balls or a bag of tuna (i can only finish half the bag because the tuna is still heavy for me). Another protein shake a few hours later. And dinner is usually a 1/2bag tuna and light mayo OR 2.5/3oz seared salmon. (Poultry is rough on my stomach. Seared or raw fish is a lot more comfortable for me than any other meat protein at this point).
I do 40min biking and 10min weights 6 days a week. 
This is the meal/shake/exercise plan recommended by my wls team (who have been amazing). 

Iâ€™m just so frustrated even though Iâ€™ve been told the very rational, very well researched truth that itâ€™s normal to stall at this point. Iâ€™ve seen tons of posts with people feeling the same frustration. Which is, honestly, very comforting and helpful. But itâ€™s still just so aggravating. Of course i refuse to give up and i refuse to not do the work.
 
I guess my question is what did everyone who has faced a similar directly post surgery stall do to deal with the frustration? 

Tl;Dr...stalled and frustrated halp!

Also. Sorry if I got The Byrds in anyoneâ€™s head. "
First thing I thought of when I weighed in at 165 this morning after being almost 300 lbs 6 months ago...ï¿½ï¿½,
"6 weeks post-op, down 25 pounds, 88 since the before photo.",
Consultation: Scheduled!,"So I finally was able to get a referral from my PCP and scheduled the first appointment with a surgeon! I had a question though. After the first appointment with the surgeon, about how long did it take yâ€™all to get the surgery scheduled? Iâ€™m so excited!"
First Steps,"Hello,

Iâ€™m new here! I have some questions on first steps, and Iâ€™m hoping that I can maybe get some tips here. Iâ€™ve been reading a lot of posts in preparation. 

Iâ€™ve decided to get WLS. I am 27 and weigh 402lbs, and have no co-morbidities. Currently I live in WI and it is not covered by my insurance. However, soon I am moving to IL and to my understanding IL has different state laws that may mean that I have a better chance of getting insurance that covers WLS. Either that, or Iâ€™m prepared to go to Mexico. 

Next week I have an appointment with a â€œweight managementâ€ clinic that is covered under my current insurance. My question is, what can I talk to them about or maybe do to try and get as much done as possible under this insurance to set myself up for getting approved for surgery in the future? (Iâ€™d love to get it done before December). Iâ€™m hoping to get a prescription for Vyanayse, but I am not sure if that is covered on insurance. I may meet with a dietician as well if thereâ€™s time."
WLS as a SAHM?,"Iâ€™m currently in the middle of IVF to have a second child. If everything works out, in Spring 2020 I will give birth to baby #2 and my son will be 2.5. 

I really want to have the gastric sleeve after weâ€™re done having kids. But Iâ€™m concerned about the pain and being able to care for 2 kids, and also I want to breastfeed. Has anyone had WLS with young kids or while nursing?"
NSV I didn't have to stretch out my XL tshirt to make myself look less fat!,No one noticed but I did. It doesn't sound like much but I felt unashamed of my weight for the first time in 13 years.
Seven week stall?,"Did anyone else have a stall around seven or eight weeks out? I was eating under my calories for a few days and I thought that was why, but Iâ€™ve been back up to where I should be for three or four days, and still no movement. I had a particularly long four week stall, so I am not prepared to stop losing weight again. I feel like I am going to be the person who only loses a small amount of weight (27 lbs since surgery, 52 overall, want to lose about another 108) and it just makes me so anxious. Did anyone just stop losing after a couple of months?"
"I finally broke my stall, then got the flu, and Iâ€™m now 101 lbs down from my highest known weight!","Despite getting the flu vaccine, Iâ€™ve been miserably sick since the weekend.  Iâ€™ve lost 3lbs in 3 days and thatâ€™s following a recent stall-breaking loss of 2.5 lbs last week.  I am now officially 101 lbs down from my highest known weight September 2017.  323 &gt; 222 Woo hoo!"
"NSV today, rode my bike!","I've always liked biking but just the 3/4 mile ride to the train and I'd be winded. Today I commuted all the way into work and back for the first time ever. 20 miles round trip and though sore, I feel GREAT. No cramps, no excessive sweating, just an overall enjoyable ride. 70 pounds makes a gigantic difference in rolling resistance."
"I just got my date! May 13th, any surgery twins??",I'm so excited but also freaking out lol.
8 weeks out and feeling bleh,"Let me begin by saying that I have an appointment with my surgeon on Monday morning -- day after tomorrow as I write this -- and will be bringing this up with him then. Not to worry! I'm just writing this to see if anyone else has had this experience (I'm sure I'm far from unique), and how it went for you. 

I'm nearly 8 weeks out from surgery, and have started having an uncomfortable problem. It's a little hard to describe, but I'm getting a sort of intermittent crampy feeling in my upper abdomen throughout the day. It comes on and subsides quickly -- it usually lasts no more than 2-3 seconds -- and while it's not terribly painful, it's uncomfortable. It also occasionally happens up closer to my throat, which makes me thing it's something esophagus-related. It doesn't seem to be related to eating or drinking -- eating makes it neither better nor worse. It does seem to be somewhat related to activity, in that it happens more often when I'm up and active, and less often when I'm sitting or laying still. But it can still happen then, too. It's often, but not always, accompanied by a little burp or hiccup. 

It also seems to produce a little bit of low-level nausea, along the lines of sour stomach or a little indigestion, but it's enough to make the thought of eating/drinking less appealing and more work. 

No vomiting, no reflux or heartburn, no fevers or other symptoms. Just this recurring ""ouch"" under my ribs.

Any ideas?"
Latest gain eliminated and so can you,"Just wanted to send something encouraging. 
Last week I posted that I had gained 6 pounds because I stopped tracking and did not move and kind of did not pay attention cause of some changes that seemed more important at the moment. 
The scale had shocked me. 

I have started to walk once a day and counted everything and was around 1000 calories every day. I even went on a little vacation last weekend in the woods and walked 2 miles (1/2 uphill). 

Today I stepped on the scale and I was down 6 pounds. Yaehhhh. 

Mission weight correction is accomplished. 

If I can do that so can everybody. You just have to catch it soon enough so adjustments donâ€™t feel like a big thing. If I had continued this for month and gained more the correction would have been much more painful."
CTE Conference Before and After,
PCOS as comorbidity?,"Hello! I have a consult next Tuesday to pursue WLS. I am 5â€™4 and 225 pounds. My BMI is 38. 
I have high blood pressure, but I looked into my insurance and it says that PCOS, insulin resistance, and depression are comorbidities as well. But the woman I spoke to on the phone who set up my consult said that those arenâ€™t comorbidities. Iâ€™m not sure which has the upper hand, insurance or the surgeon? 
My other question is, I have high blood pressure but donâ€™t take anything for it (I havenâ€™t since I lost 60lbs in the past, but regained it all the last year and havenâ€™t restarted taking medication for it). Will that impact the eligibility of it being a CM?

Anyone here start at over 600 pounds?,I am just wondering if anyone here started as big as me. Did you get rny or vsg? How much did you have to lose before surgery? What has your progress been like?
I'm in the losers club now!,"Hi everyone!  I just got back from the hospital a few hours ago (VSG) and I'm really pleased with the whole experience.  I have some pain, but it's along the lines of doing way too many sit-ups or crunches the day before.  My surgeon's got a ton of fans (all the nurses love him) because he goes out of his way to help manage both pain and nausea. I've been sipping on water, broth and premier protein caramel for the last few hours and it's all stayed down.  

&amp;#x200B;

I feel absolutely lucky and happy that my health plan led me down this road, and I'm thrilled to have this sub to turn to for questions and concerns.

Breaking stall tips?,Iâ€™m 3 weeks post op and I seem to have stalled. I havenâ€™t lost anything in 8 days. Iâ€™m eating around 600-700 calories a day and walking on the treadmill for 30 min 5 days a week. Does anyone have any tips on how to break the stall?
Anorexia after RNY,Hi. I had RNY in November 2016 with no complications. I'm now almost 3 years out and I think I may have anorexia. I started smoking again and I think it's caused ulcers because I'm in EXCRUCIATING pain but I'm scared to go to my surgeon because the are SO anti- smoking and they're going to blame everything on that. I never want to eat and I have to force myself. After the first few bites it's like chewing becomes a chore and I get grossed out and spot out my food. The last time I was weighed I was 87 pounds (I'm 5 ft 1) but that was 2onths ago and I'm scared to step on the scale because I know I've lost much more. None of my pants fit me they're all too big. I've REALLY neglected my health by smoking and not taking vitamins and not forcing protein in. I'm laying here now in the worst pain. I haven't eaten all day and I know I should but it's gonna hurt. Did anyone else get anorexia after any kind of WLS? I found a group on Facebook but most of the people on there have buliemia because they are still trying to reach goal weight so they're not much support to me. I'm scared.
"Iâ€™m feeling great and I want to share,","Iâ€™m 6 months out from the modified duodenal switch (vsg) surgery, and I feel amazing. My highest weight was289 pounds. At my first appointment with my surgeon I was 278 pounds, and I was 274 on surgery day. Today, I weigh 172 pounds, And Iâ€™m not done. My goal weight is about 125 to 130 pounds, so I have 40 to 50 pounds to go, but I still feel amazing. ï¿¼

Everything is so much easier to do physically. I feel so much better about myself. Iâ€™m down from a size 26 pants to a size 10, and most of my shirts are transitioning from standard larges to mediums, and I can buy them anywhere I want. People often mention how much better I look, or how skinny I am getting. And all that is wonderful but it isnâ€™t really why I feel great.

I feel great because I feel like I want to. I have broken through something that has held me down for so much of my life, and I finally feel like my addiction to food is no longer something that has power over me, and that I am capable of doing this and doing it forever. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted, figuratively and literally, and itâ€™s wonderful knowing that when people see Me, fat is no longer the first thing they see. 

Iâ€™m not finished losing, and I know that this is going to be a fight and a choice I have to make every day for the rest of my life, but I finally feel like Iâ€™m capable of making that choice, and like Iâ€™m able to do this successfully for the first time. I feel like one of those big scary questions that you have asked about yourself as a human being has finally been answered and I got the answer I was hoping for.  I always figured that I would always be fat because I simply did not have it in me to make the changes necessary to be healthy, but I donâ€™t think that anymore, and I feel like the people here who are going through the same thing are the only ones who could understand that. When you are obese, people often just ask you why you donâ€™t go on a diet and Lose weight, but they donâ€™t know how difficult a process it is and how overwhelming it can be. Itâ€™s good to know that it can be done."
VSG vs. RNY: Canâ€™t decide!,"Iâ€™m 5â€™6â€ 310 lb and 24 years old. I have lower back pain, taking psych meds and have no major other medical issues... 
My doctor told me that they usually recommend RNY but that because I almost never get acid reflux and donâ€™t have other health issues I would be a great candidate for either!
But said that I might lose more weight with RNY.

She said the decision is up to to! Any stories, personal experiences and advice greatly appreciated!!"
NSV: Took my first vacation since surgery and I didnt go nuts. I ate some junk food and went out a lot but still averaged 900 calories a day,"Before surgery vacation would have been a free for all. On a road trip I likely would have eaten 3000-5000 calories a day. On two different trips my husband and I ate an entire cake. While I did go out more than I like to, I still was conscious of what I was eating and logged my calories. On the road we packed water, protein shakes, nuts and yogurt and ate that instead of gas station food. Losing weight is wonderful but watching my attitude about food change is honestly the best part of surgery."
I fucked up.,"Two weeks post op and I had too big a day yesterday, and ate somethingâ€™s I shouldnâ€™t have. Did this to myself...so let this be a reminder lol - heal, donâ€™t push yourself, donâ€™t test the post-op diet boundaries...taking it super easy today."
Low platelet count,Has anyone had problems with a low platelet count? I'm almost 3 years out of vsg. Been taking my vitamins diligently and cut out all bad food. Any insights?
Any recommended wls programs in roseville or sac or CA,"A lot of the programs iâ€™ve looked at or heard of have a really long wait list, as in requirements by the surgeon. My insurance doesnâ€™t necessarily have any restrictions beyond eligibility. But some surgeons have a lot of hoop jumping beyond labs and stuff. Does anyone know of any programs in the roseville or sac area or in CA in where the surgery date is not so far into the future usually?"

"To Past, Present and future WLSers","Life is not fair. It's never meant to be fair. That's why it's worth living.

I know I started with a very generic saying but this is something that you should keep in your mind always. If you find yourself in a situation, where you need a WLS to get better, don't pity on yourself nor see yourself less just because you need to do so.

It doesn't matter if you tried everything else or nothing at all. If you know you're in the WLS-range than you should consider it as an option.

But... you should only consider it, if you plan to make it work... What do I mean by that? Don't think of WLS as an easy ""temporary"" way out of your problems. It's a boost. Nothing else. You should work for it to work for you.

When I had my WLS, I was close to 160 kgs (~352 pounds). 18 months later,  I'm 100 kgs (220 pounds). Don't get me wrong, I got leaner during this 18 months but my main goal was never to lose the weight but to lose the fat. My goal is to get to 10% total fat mass, currently I'm at 22%.

The issues that got me to 160 kgs still exist in my daily life. But I'm choosing to face them and not give up. That's my secret weapon: never giving up on myself. I can take a detour, skip gym for a week or eat some unhealthy stuff one day but I don't let those be the end. There is always the next day.

I don't look at this a sprint but a long marathon. So, there is always the next day, week, month and year for me to not give up.

This is why I wanted to write this. If you are considering WLS, get in to the correct mindset first. It is not a easy ride to healthy-ville. Don't give up on yourself and keep making the next steps. So one day, you can look back and see how far you've gotten.

This is really it!,"First off, thank you all for your posts and comments. Iâ€™ve been lurking here for almost a year and feel so much more informed.  This is an invaluable resource and I am so grateful.

I got the call a week ago that my info had been submitted to insurance. Tomorrow starts my two week pre-op liquid diet. Itâ€™s real and itâ€™s scary.  Iâ€™m just hoping I have the will power to do this.  I have to. No turning back now!"
Sleeved YESTERDAY (6/21),"And feeling great today (6/22). Walking every hour, taking meds as needed (havenâ€™t needed abt nausea meds today). Iâ€™ve been having sips of  water, or sugar free white grape juice every 15-25 min or as I can tolerate it. Iâ€™ve done a small amount of veggie broth (couple tea spoons). And now Iâ€™m even trying my first protein shake with ease. Why is this such a smooth process for me? Iâ€™m kinda scared."
Belly band for men? Which one to get?,"Hi there,

Purgatory,"Today was supposed to be my surgery day... but because I submitted photographic evidence instead of doctors visit reports, itâ€™s going to take longer. Iâ€™m on the two-shake pre-op diet, one meal a day, indefinitely until surgery. Anyone else have to just wait in limbo, hungry, until insurance gave you the green light?"

Buying guide for post op (Protein Snacks and powders),"So I have gotten pretty adept at working the systems at my favorite stores and spend a decent amount of money ($100-125) every week at them for for my family. Is anyone interested in trading secrets for buying products for WLS? I think there could be some good tricks to help us all save cash in the long run. You dont have to order everything online to get a good deal, stores like GNC and Vitamin Shoppe can suffice if you know how to work their systems. Anybody up to it?"
Quicker than expected recovery.,"Stats:
32 years old
Height: 5'7
HW: 357 lbs
SW: 292.3.lbs
GW: 170ish. 

Back in October of 2011, I had an adjustable gastric band put in. Let's just say it was unsuccessful.

I lost a bunch of weight on it but I regained all of my weight back and then some. My mom had an RNY about 10 years ago. She too needed a WLS surgeon. I did some research and found one of the best that actually perform DSes. My mom is down 143 pounds and I am down a total 64.7 pounds, although I gained ten pounds from surgery. 

I am a few days post op. I have some vicodin, prilosec and zofran to hold me over. I was virtually painless in the hospital and at home, I haven't been above a 5 or 6.

If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask me here or message me privately. I am familiar with all surgeries, etc.

Wish those a speedy recovery who are recovering.
Wish those who are nervous to just relax, everything will be okay.
Wish those who are losing to continue to lose, you're doing really well.
If you're in a tough spot, don't beat yourself up. Everything change soon enough. Patience. :-)"
WLS Progression 174 - 84 KG,
Early Stall,"My surgery was in June.  Wonderful experience, with zero pain and no complications.
I stopped losing weight a month ago, about the time I started the â€œsoft foodâ€ phase.  Iâ€™ve lost about 20 lbs total since the surgery (about 90% of that the second and third week after surgery).  Iâ€™m not giving up or giving in to temptations, but very frustrated.  I feel like this is really, really early for this to happen!  
Iâ€™m getting lots of protein (60-80 grams a day).  Iâ€™m taking my supplements, doing my very best with water and liquids.
I just ordered a new scale, as my old one seems to be all over the place with body fat %.  
Please advise."
Vitamin Supplement Schedule,"I want to first begin by stating that I follow the reccomendation of spacing my calcium and multivitamins out by atleast two hours in order to avoid issues with iron and calcium. I also avoid consuming caffinated beverages at least 2 hours before and after I take any supplement. I use an application called medisafe to keep track of my supplements. I'm curious to know exactly how everyone goes about their regimen? Any advice that anyone can offer would be appreciated. Here is mine below;

1. \~7am - calcium and b sublingual
2. \~10am - multivitamin
3. \~2pm - second calcium
4. \~4:30 -  second multivitamin.
5. \~7pm - vitamin D2 supplement (only once a month)

Optifast? Taste and do I really have to use them?,I am getting closer to my 2 week liquid diet and I was wondering if anyone else has had the Optifast diet and how did it taste? I have my last NUT visit and my surgeon visit tomorrow and trying to figure out if I can use my own shakes which my NUT did approve already in place of the optifast diet shakes. Everything I have been given by the office makes it sound like Iâ€™m required to use the optifast products but do I really have to? They are a bit pricier than the other shakes I use and any cost cutting helps towards the money I would need to pay for the surgery itself (insurance covering most). Please help.

Question about boney protrusions,"I didn't really know where else to post this. I know this is a good and bad issue to have, but it's so uncomfortable sometimes I don't know how skinny people deal with it. I've lost about 120lbs in total so far and with it, I've started to become uncomfortable sitting in certain positions or in certain chairs. My sitz bone hurts like a mf all the time. I had to get a cushion to sit on and I feel like an old lady. My spine seems to protrude more and I can't do floor exercises without a mat or sit in most curved chairs because it hurts a lot. Does this end up going away after a while? What tricks can I use to get some comfort?"

Eating is too easy?,"Hi everyone,

I had vsg on 2/5.  Iâ€™m on my third day of purÃ©ed foods and it seems like eating is almost too easy.  For example, I ate one scrambled egg in 12 minutes.  From what Iâ€™ve read and seen on social media, it takes a lot of people much longer to finish an egg.  Iâ€™m meeting my water and step goals, my macros are where they should be, vitamins like clockwork, and of course sticking to the portions recommended for someone at my stage.  Iâ€™m down a total of 62 pounds, 15 of those lost post op. 

Am I just a fast healer, or maybe my stomach didnâ€™t swell up too much to begin with?  The anxious me is worried Iâ€™ll eventually overeat or my restriction will never be small enough.  The rational me says to relax and that Iâ€™m probably fine.  Has anyone had a similar experience? "
Did anyone go through a weird â€˜Iâ€™m bored with lifeâ€™ situation after surgery?,"Iâ€™m nearly 8 weeks post op. Recovery has been ok but I just walking through life bored now.

Iâ€™m bored with food
Iâ€™m bored with my life as a stay at home mum
Iâ€™m bored with my lack of energy which is kind of keeping me from doing a few things
Iâ€™m just bored.
I could totally see myself getting out of hand with vaping weed if I let myself, with the whole transfer addiction thing.
Iâ€™m not really sure how to get out of this hole.
Iâ€™m enrolled to start further study in a few months so I guess itâ€™s probably good timing for that so I can sink my teeth into somthing new but everything else seems kind a lack lustre and beige to me.

"14 days post op and ran a lowish fever 101 degrees and HR 113 bpm with extreme chills, then ok?","I'm 15 days post op VSG, BMI 40, male. 

for the first few days post op I took Miralax and had soft big stools. I'm glad because before surgery those protein poops were huge and hard and caused anal bleeding so I said after surgery I will do miralax to prevent that post op.

So last night (2ish weeks post op with no complications) after taking a massive poop that tore my butthole (lots of blood) from what I think is a anal fissure or something like that inside, I was sitting on the couch for three hours before developing extreme chills. So I put on hoodie, socks, and positioned myself in front of a space heater. My resting heart rate was about 113 bpm, 101 degree fever, chills, but NO OTHER symptoms (no adbominal pain or shoulder pain).

Went to bed by 1 am when the temperature stabilized and because it didn't seem like a leak and this morning I am back to normal temperature (97 something degrees). 

Any idea what that was? Did my poop bacteria enter my blood stream and cause that reaction? My coworker was sniffling and touching his nose saying it was allergies but maybe he had the flu? Do I potentially have a gastric leak? Is this normal? I'm going to call my doctor when they get in the office.

Edit: called the nurse and she wasn't sure but took down all the symptoms and said to monitor fever and keep getting fluids 64oz and taking miralax 1 x per day. She said maybe it sounds like he was constipated. 

Now the fever is back at 100.6 with gas and flatulence and pulse 103 bpm after waking up. I'll call again but I feel fine.

Edit: they want us to stop drinking immediately, go back to the hospital to run a urinalysis, blood work and  gastrophin swallow radiology exam out of precaution.

Edit: no leak and blood work was normal. Maybe picked up a little bug or the BM thing."
Weaning off Prilosec (Omeprazole)?,"Hi everyone,

I was sleeved about a month ago, and at my three week follow-up appointment my doctor casually instructed to eventually wean off the 2 x 20mg Omeprazole I'm currently on. My question is 1) how? 2) exactly when should I begin doing that? I started eating more textured foods today (tuna salad, chili, noodle-less lasagna with ground turkey whist chewing very well) and am tolorating everything fine, if that matters. I should have asked more questions but it was like an offhand comment."

6 month diet for insurance...have to stay at the same BMI.,"So Iâ€™m about to start my 6 month diet/nutrition classes for the insurance approval. My initial BMI was 35.1. Right on the cusp... I asked them what would happened if I lost weight and they said insurance could deny me but they also said they submit initial weight from the consult. Theyâ€™re being a little vague about it saying the dietician will know to keep me at my same weight as well. 
I want to start incorporating habits of eating healthy and exercise now so I can transition easier after my VSG but Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll lose weight ( never said that before! Haha). 
Iâ€™m sure every insurance company and surgeon is different but has anyone been through this? "

Iâ€™m so excited to be 3 months post surgery. It was an extremely rough start after surgery, but I want to help console people who are concerned about complications: itâ€™s still worth it. I havenâ€™t been under 200lbs in over 10 years. The blood loss, recovery struggles, etc were all worth it. Iâ€™ve been feeling great and Iâ€™ve been getting compliments left and right from people I work with, friends, family. Iâ€™m able to play certain sports that I struggled with because of knee pain. Iâ€™m just over halfway to my goal weight and I already feel the monumental changes. 

I absolutely recommend taking measurements and taking monthly pictures vs checking your weight. I stalled for over a week two times and both times I was still losing inches even if the weight hadnâ€™t shifted. It was comforting to see. Today I put on my first pair of size 14 jeans and they actually fit! I was a size 20 for so many years. Iâ€™ve also found that my love of food has transferred into a love of cooking for friends/family. I'm still struggling to get in the recommended water and food, but I'm hoping the water will eventually get really easy to take larger gulps.

First Non Scale Victory,"Hi everyone!! Iâ€™ve had my first non scale victory. I had my RNY surgery two weeks ago on April 10. Iâ€™ve finally been able to wear shoes and not be in an incredible amount of pain in my feet. Mostly because my edema has been reduced to the point that I was able to put my shoes on and had extra room. Fitting into shoes without pain and edema hasnâ€™t happened in about 7 years. I was beyond happy. Edema prevented me from getting around as easily as I would have liked.

How to get in all this food?,"My nutritionist upped my calories to 1000, with a minimum of 60 g of protein and 100 g of carb, because Iâ€™ve been going into dka a bunch from being so low calorie and low carb (so I would have dietary ketosis, which would turn into ketoacedosis every time my blood sugar went high). My problem is that in the couple days since Iâ€™ve been on this new plan I havenâ€™t managed to get in more than 850 calories no matter how hard I try. I usually sleep for about 10 or more hours a day, because of chronic illness, so Iâ€™m up at most 14 hours. I generally feel too nauseous to eat or drink for a few hours after I wake up so letâ€™s say that takes me down to 11 hours in which to eat 1000 calories and drink at least 64 oz of water (I find I do better with a little more than that, maybe 100 oz) Thatâ€™s a lot to get in, with so much restriction! Oh, Iâ€™m almost exactly four months out from surgery. I can eat about 1/2 cup at a time I would say. Most of my meals range from 50-250 calories so I would average maybe six or seven small meals a day, and I find I can do about 12 oz of fluid at a time so say a minimum of six drinks. Waiting a half hour between drinks and meals I should be able to get everything in but I would basically have to eat back to back, because of course it takes time to eat and drink too. I donâ€™t know, does anyone have any ideas?"

1.6 years post sleeve and struggling with my appetite and worried about gaining weight.,"I donâ€™t really have a purpose for this post except to get some stuff of my chest and to hear any thoughts or comments that have helped you guys through something similar. 

I had the sleeve in July 2017 and went from 250 to 145. Iâ€™ve been maintaining between 145 and 150 consistently for the past 5 months. Iâ€™m 5â€™3 and 29 years old. I really want to lose a little bit more but Iâ€™ve just been stuck. Iâ€™ve started lifting instead of concentrating on cardio but I feel like I have no idea what Iâ€™m doing and I canâ€™t tell if Iâ€™m pushing myself hard enough because Iâ€™m such a beginner Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m going to hurt myself. In the meantime, Iâ€™ve felt my appetite increase pretty substantially. I feel like I just want to scarf my food down all the time. I feel like I just want to snack ALL the time. I just feel those old habits wanting to creep in and itâ€™s terrifying. My boyfriend doesnâ€™t understand because he thinks Iâ€™m too strict with myself. He lives off junk food but has never really have a weight problem because he has a very physical job. 

I think I just need to buckle down and plan this week out on my fitness pal and make sure I have healthy snacks available so Iâ€™m not tempted by his junk food. Itâ€™s been a frustrating couple of months with other personal things and I can feel the old desire to turn to junk food for comfort... I just have to remain strong. "

"Gastric Sleeve, PCOS and Disordered eating","Sorry it's long!

I am hoping to gain some perspective from people in alike situations.
I have PCOS and as such have health related issues because of it (weight gain, hormonal imbalance, recently diagnosed with diabetes etc)
I have also had issues with disordered eating in the last decade or so. I find myself going through stages of heavy binging and gaining 30-50kg in a year or obsessively exercising and culling calories to 400-500 and consequently loosing massive amounts of weight quickly.
I've been sizes 10-26AU in the last 4 years for example. 
I am currently around my heaviest. 
Consequently this along with my PCOS has impacted my liver, resulted in type 2 diabetes and left me feeling chronically fatigued. 

I have recently started visiting a great doctor, who has suggested two routes of treatment. 

1. Lifestyle change with the help of a Food Phycologist to aid my disordered eating OR
2. Gastric Bypass. She agrees this seems extreme but she's worried my back and forth weight loss with do more damage to my health and thinks that I need something that will force me to keep on track.

The idea of surgery scares me, but also the thought of continuing the yo-yo-ing seems exhausting and I'm worried I'll just keep going back and forth from sick and obese to thin, sickly and utterly obsessed with food.  

Has anyone else been in a similar situation or has dealt with disordered eating AND WLS?

Thank you"

Post Surgical Pain?,"Hello all! Iâ€™m posting for the first time! Iâ€™m having the Roux En Y in July. Iâ€™m not overly concerned with the diet changes, Iâ€™ve already started working on that(I drink a protein smoothie for breakfast and drink a gallon of water a day(have up soda 4 years ago and maybe have one 1-2x per month of that) and have reduced my caffeine intake, and no snacking after dinner. So I know Iâ€™m on the right path with that. The only thing that scares me is two things: 1) Itâ€™s major surgery and Iâ€™m 380 lb I am nervous about any number of complications (blood clots/ death mainly) and 2) I donâ€™t handle pain well.  How bad is it post op?"
Having a hard time (post-op day seven),"I had my RNY on the 23rd of April. Today is post-op day 7. I have eaten nothing but broth (mainly homemade dashi), protein shakes, decaf tea and flavored waters. I am so freaking over protein shakes. I can barely get them down but do it because I know that I need to hit my protein goal. My program advances you to stage 3a (as they call it) on PO day 14. That stage is essentially pureed foods and it lasts one week. 

I just want to get there. I am feeling depressed, tired, and am mourning my old eating habits. I know that this surgery was the best thing that could happen to me but right now it sucks. On the plus side, I have lost around 30lb from my heaviest weight (shortly before surgery)."
WLS in Mexico alone?,Considering going to Mexico for WLS. I really have no one I can take with me. Can I do this alone? I'm normally very self reliant.
Day 7: Finally home,"Well I'm finally home, but still extremely weak. It's hard to walk around right now, but it's getting easier. I had a GI bleed that healed itself. I ended up getting blood transfusions because I was so pale and anemic I was shivering nonstop and my hands and feet kept going numb from lack of circulation. The scary part was that my heart rate would spoke to 155-165 while walking and my resting rate was 120ish. They did all sorts of CT and ultrasound tests but found nothing in particular. They think I just had awful nausea that forced me to puke non-stop and that coupled with a small GI bleed equaled 1 liter  of bloody vomit and who knows how much black stool. This was probably worst case scenario but I felt lucky that my pain was never that bad. 

Good/bad news is I lost 10 pounds in the hospital, but it was because I couldn't eat/drink well. So thankful I had this community to read before the surgery as I knew this was a worst case scenario only a few experienced."
Let's talk trackers and apps on the cheap! (android/PC),"Short about me: 45 years old, got sleeved on Nov 6, 2018.

I'm not all that flush financially, and I have to kind of 'get by' with what I happen into, in terms of deals and such. Years ago, I bought a Fitbit Ultra, but it died a long time ago. I happened to get a good deal on a used Samsung Gear Fit (first generation), and while I don't have a samsung phone, I've found an app that lets me at least use the gear fit watch. I'm also told that it's pedometer function is pretty bad. The app I've got indicates that it can interface with Google Fit, but it's not very timely about sharing it's data with Google... making the Google Fit app and info displays grossly lagging behind.

I've tried several ""pedometer' apps on my phone, and while the aptly named ""Pedometer"" app by Simple Design does seem to function at least as well as the Gear Fit.. it's not really able to share it's data with any other apps. 

I picked up one of those ultra-cheap ""Styr"" fitness trackers, but their app is just a scheme to sell you stuff.

I've used MyFitnessPal's webpage for years, but the android app leaves a lot to be desired, and post bariatric surgery, well the MFP system is constantly having panic attacks because I'm barely making 900-1000 calories in a day.

Adding into all of this, I just got a FANTASTIC deal on a treadmill at a St Vincent DePaul thrift store.. $25! ($50 on a 50% off tag).

So I'm starting to want to tie all this stuff together. I can do it more or less manually.. hand entering the treadmill time, and calories after each use, same as I do when I weigh myself on my 'dumb' scale. But I'd really like to find a way to bridge at least the pedometer and MFP. Equally, I'm willing to migrate from MFP to some other platform if it's easier to make it all happen someplace else. (the daily freakouts over my calorie intake have been.. less than enjoyable)

So I put this out there to you all. Whatcha got in terms of advice? Devices, Apps, Fitness sites, etc. I'm looking for cheap-to-free, and I don't mind a few ads... but I'm kind of struggling with the tools I am using right now."
I feel like a wls failure,"I had vsg on 3/20/18. I was a 207 5â€™2â€ on my surgery day. Today I am 152. I have been hovering around the same +\- 3 pounds since October. I have 25lbs to my goal. Yesterday I decided to get back on the wagon and track what I was eating. I ate about 1500 calories and I know that I ate less then I have been because I stopped myself from going to the kitchen several times.  Now I know Iâ€™ve lost about 75% of my excess and have managed to not start gaining but the eating is old me. I feel like a failure. Today Iâ€™m trying to get back on track. Itâ€™s hard all over again. Getting used to the lower calories, focusing on protein. 
I am so angry and ashamed that I let myself fall right back to where I was, 50lbs lighter but no different in my head. "
A few questions...,"1. I had to pay out of pocket for my psychiatrist appointment it was $200. I called my insurance and they said they canâ€™t even put that towards my deductible or out of pocket maximum because it wasnâ€™t covered. I feel like this should go towards my out of pocket max! Frustrating... 

2. My surgeon said (based on my insurance) I only need to do the following; 
Psychiatrist mental health evaluation âœ…
Nutritionist appt (5/21)
EKG (5/21)
Lab work (5/21)
Ultrasound (5/21)
X-ray (5/21) 

He said after I get results from those I should be able to set a date for my surgery. From my consult he said I could be having surgery in a month or two. However Iâ€™m nervous that the nutritionist might make me do a 6 month weight loss plan, or something that will delay the process. Can a nutritionist overrule the surgeons timeline? 

3. I will be applying for FMLA for the recovery period. I do not want my boss or manager to know anything about my surgery besides that Iâ€™m having surgery and Iâ€™ll be out for X weeks. Is this possible? The people I work with are really dramatic and negative and I really donâ€™t want them talking shit about me. Iâ€™ve heard them make comments about a coworker who openly talked about wanting to better their life with RNY and they put her down. I want to avoid them being in my business.


Thank you all in advance!!!"
How are your migraines after wls?,"Hi all, I'm just starting my journey. Waiting for my paperwork to come in the mail (hope the snow isn't delaying it), and to have my orientation class scheduled. I'm looking things up, trying to find out as much about the different weight loss surgeries and what to expect from all of them as I can. One thing I haven't really found is information on the number and severity of migraines post wls. My migraines are not terribly frequent now, and seem to be hormonally triggered for the most part. Both times when I was pregnant I had a week of migraines every day at the beginning of my pregnancy and it was awful. I've read that hormones are stored in fat and can cause some side effects as you lose the weight. 

People who suffer from migraines, did you notice your migraines becoming more frequent or more severe as you lost weight? If so, did they taper off as you got closer to your goal weight, or as the weight loss slowed?"

Scheduled 1st Consult Visit in May,"Fâ€¢27â€¢5â€™6.5â€â€¢265lbs

In 2017 I had a consult scheduled and then chickened out on the process thinking I could do it without surgery. Here I am two years later and 10lbs heavier.  Iâ€™m a nurse and Iâ€™ve spent hours researching on the sleeve and RNY. I havenâ€™t had children and I am worried about vitamin intake, so Iâ€™ll probably go with the sleeve. I do not have GERD, but Iâ€™m worried about reflux. I have a history of obesity in my family and after failing to lose weight for the past 5 years, I know this is my only option to be healthy. I called my insurance and they will cover the procedure if I go through a 6 month process (not sure what that entails). I have a great support system of my amazing husband and family. 

If anyone has any advice or things they wish they knew in my stage/pre-op or of youâ€™ve done the similar 6 month process, any advice would be greatly appreciated!"
Post Op Scars,"I donâ€™t see many posts about incisions or difficulties with incisions.

I had RNY April 22 and I have an incredibly tender wound the size of a dime. The rest have healed, but this one is still open on the edges and at the belly button line so all of my pants tug on it, if not sit on it. 

Is this normal? I showed my doctor at 4 weeks post off and said my only complaint of this entire thing was the pain of that one wound and he said â€œlooks fineâ€."

Successfully maintaining but not sure if I should be trying to lose more.,"Quick backstory since I don't normally post to this subreddit often.
I had weight loss surgery in 2015, and successfully lost 160lbs. I've been maintaining my weight loss and stabilized in the mid-180s since the end of 2016. I workout, I eat healthy. I love meal prep. I have lived my life in balance for the last 2 and some years, so while I have not lost more - I feel great and comfortable in my skin. (Current sizes: shirts S or M, pants anywhere from 8-12 depending on brand and cut - i have a lot of loose skin on my lower stomach and thighs which affects pants more so than shirts).

So here is the thing. I felt great. I was only beating myself up if I started getting high on my maintenance range, but I have not actively tried to lose more since I hit below my doctors goal for me. Apparently my husband and family all thought I was still trying to lose, and even if I'm not - I should still be giving it 100% in the gym and i'm supposedly not right now. I go to the gym because I know I feel better when i workout, so i try to just consistently move my body and do mild weight lifting. I have no desire to lift heavy or run races - those things have never motivated me in the past.

Idk. I have a very popular instagram dictating my life after WLS and the pressure to be a success is high. I felt like i was a success - maintaining is f*ing hard. But am I wrong to not keep pushing, especially when BMI and clothing sizes are telling me I could be smaller/fitter?

I realize typing this out that i would tell anyone saying this to me to 'screw the haters and do what is right for you' - but I want to be motivational and I want to make helping people with beating obesity a career in the future.

I can't tell if it is just self doubt, or if it is actually dumb for me to think I can go down that road without being a gym rat and losing more weight."
I had (and might still have) a leak...,"This has been the hardest thing I've ever been through (physically, emotionally, mentally), but I still think the surgery is worth it. Just finding it tough to stay positive and look forward to the future without the constant fear that this isn't over. I'm sure as time passes I will start feeling normal again, but it's tough to not over analyze every little pain, pressure, or twinge. Anyone else experience a leak? "
Dairy free post op recipes/tips?,"Hi all!

Thanks for everyone's response on my last post, you are all so awesome.

Is anyone else here who has had sleeve/bypass surgery allergic to dairy? I am allergic to casein and I am having trouble finding recipes that tick all the boxes...low carb, low sugar, high protein &amp; dairy free. The cookbook I posted in my last submission includes a lot of dairy, and there are no easy subs for some of the ingredients. Non dairy subs that I can buy from the store for things like yogurt are super high in sugar and I'm not sure i'll be feeling well enough post op to cook everything from scratch, and i'll be eating so little that I think it may end up being a total waste to make all the subs from scratch because of their short shelf life. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"
Dating post-surgery - A story of bubbly wine poured into a plant,"Hi guys! So about me: I'm a female aged 25, HW 125 kg (275 lbs),Â  SW 105 kg (231 lbs) , CW 83 kg (182 lbs). I got a gastric sleeve on the 10th of September last year. 

So I had this funny experience last Friday, it's wls related and I thought I'd share. So I've been dating quite a lot lately, the weight loss has made me very confident and my loose skin still isn't too bad so I feel pretty great. I had a second date last Friday with a guy I'd met on Tinder and had previously had a pleasant 3-hour drink date with. I wasn't really feeling a spark yet, but figured I'd give him a fair chance. He invited me to his home for a homemade dinner and I accepted. I told him that I'd had surgery that restricted my food intake, but that I could eat pretty much anything, just in tiny portions. He told me was going to make me salmon so I knew I'd probably just mostly eat the fish. He also asked if I liked wine, and I told him I did. I started drinking again about 3 months after surgery and a single glass of wine will leave me pleasantly buzzed at this stage :) 

I get there and it turns out that he has bought prosecco for us to have with our meal, which is a pretty weird choice for dinner but also: My doctor has warned me against drinking carbonated drinks so I haven't had a single one since surgery. I also noticed that he had prepared a lot, a lot of food. He uncorked the bottle and enthusiastically poured me a glass and I decided to try it and see what would happen. I had one sip and it filled me up completely, so I knew this wasn't going to go well. Throughout the evening I realised that I was not attracted to this man at all, and that he was actually quite boring. But he kept on filling my glass, and I kept on emptying it. I was trying to be polite and I knew it would be our last date so I didn't want to be a worse dinner guest than I already was I think. Little did he know that I barely drank at all. I poured some into the sink when he went to the bathroom, I poured some into a big potted plant when he turned his back to me on the sofa and I poured some into into the bowl I'd used to wash the veggies for the salad that I helped him with. Throughout the night he had given me three full glasses of prosecco and I took maybe 3 sips total. He didn't notice a thing! I've never felt so much like a romcom lead in my life. 

In the end we had a disappointing kiss, after which I left quickly and the next day I declined a third date. 

So I just wanted to share this story for anyone curious about dating post-surgery. I've had some nice dates so far, normally I focus on activities that don't involve eating so that I don't have to bring up my surgery all the time. 

Good luck everyone :) "

"6 month post RNY - What weight loss rate is ""normal""?","Hey all!

I'm 6 months posrt RNY, down about 110 lbs, 83 lbs post surgery.

I had my  6 month appointment with my dietitian, and she wants me to cut 100-200 calories(I'm averaging about 1200-1400). But I'm also burning 800-1000 calories at the gym daily, and I'm not touching carbs really, so I would need to cut veggies or protein to get it down.  


I guess what I'm asking is what should I bee looking for a weight loss goal per week. I've read 3 lbs per week is good, but I 'm wondering what everyone else has experienced.

I mean, all in all, I'm doing great. I feel great and I'm putting on muscle and losing inches. My scale is showing my body fat is coming down, so I know I'm not wasting everyone's time and fooling myself that I'm doing better when I'm not."

First BM post-op RNY?,Wondering if people remember when they had their first bowel movement post RNY? I feel anxious about it and just had my surgery on Tuesday (23/07). Following my diet and staying ++ hydrated. Also moving lots!
4 years post-op and a cautionary tale,"Today I opened my Timehop and noticed memories from 4 years ago from the day after my surgery. 4 years post-op and I never met goal.

I started my journey at 293lbs (36/f at the time) and during the pre-op diet that insurance required, I lost 50lbs over the course of 7 months. The day of my VSG I weighed 243. Surgery went great, it was actually a breeze. I had zero pain, was up and walking quickly, never had the gas that so many complain about. It could not have gone better. Over the course of the next 8 months I lost another 54lbs. I was frustrated at how slow I lost after surgery. You see stories of people losing 100 in 6 months and I was nowhere near that. I remember getting to onderland which was amazing! And I kept going and one morning I finally got below 190. I remember weighing in at 189.6 and it felt like another milestone. That same day it dawned on me that my period was a good two weeks late. I tested, I was pregnant.

Hubby and I were certainly not trying. I was excited to have another child but also freaked out about how this would derail my weight loss. I immediately scheduled an appointment with my surgeon to talk about it. He assured me I should be ok. I needed to stop trying to actively lose weight, but also not go off the rails. I told myself I was going to try to maintain. At 189 I was still overweight and it would be ok to not gain at all. I just wanted to stay eating healthy. But I didnâ€™t.

I started allowing myself sweets here and there. My weight inched up VERY slowly. I remember looking at how I had started eating (granted, nowhere near how I ate pre-VSG) but I was surprised I wasnâ€™t gaining much weight! In the 3rd trimester I started to put weight on a little quicker and by the time I had my baby, I was up to 211. After baby was born, I quickly lost 10lbs. The other 11 were tough to get off but I did it within a couple of months. I was finally just about where I was pre-pregnancy when it was time to go back to work.

After maternity leave I started a new job. A very stressful job. I am a stress eater. Over the course of 18 months, I gained and gained and was at 231 in May of last year. I went on a strict low carb diet and lost 40lbs and was back down to 190 last September and then the holidays started rolling around. Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas. I had moments of binge eating and eating absolute junk for months and months and found myself ballooned back up to 230 just a couple of weeks ago. Iâ€™ve lost 10 of that doing the same diet I did last year and am now sitting at about 220. Still dealing with the desire to binge. Still feeling like my addiction to some foods is still there. Still self-loathing most days and feeling like I have zero willpower. I am sick of being fat. Iâ€™m 80lbs from my highest weight ever, but I am still fat and unhealthy and feeling like I cannot get control over this.

So WLS is not a cure or a guarantee by any means. If you do not deal with the issues that got you fat, you can and possible will, fail. Get the therapy. Do the work. Donâ€™t end up like me. I subbed here years ago after my surgery and now all it does is depress me to read the success stories. Iâ€™m happy for those of you who are succeeding. I just wish I would have too."

Four months out with big goal in eight more months,"BLUF: I want to hardcore start working out. How should I start doing this?
---
I had RNY 23APR19. I was 270 and am 201 today. My surgeon told me that I shouldn't really try to get below 190 because ""I will look gaunt"". I have been stalled at 201-203 for about three weeks. In eight months (April 2020) I will finally achieve one of my biggest life goals in becoming a [paramotor pilot](https://youtu.be/eC3E7hZwvn4?t=237). As part of the prep for this, I need to be able to run with 50-70 lb on my back until I am able to lift-off the ground. That could take dozens of yards. 

Today, I climbed ten stories of stairs and was demolished. My HR was only 106 (I take that as a good sign). How can I start building: strength, stamina and overall fitness in the wake of this dramatic surgery?

I talked to my dietician about changes to diet and she said that there is no way that I will ever be active enough to actually worry about eating more than normal. I am 32 and I hated my dietician. So, now I turn to you good folks for advice. I have a rowing machine at home and a YMCA membership (no time for group classes though)."

WLS &amp; period bloat,"Hey all. I'm 5 months out of surgery as of the 20th, and (was) down 80lbs. Since surgery my period regain has been minimal, maybe 1-2 lbs per period and then I spend about 1-2 weeks where I yo-yo between the same few pounds but do still steadily lose. This is my first period post op where I have gained some serious water weight, about 1lb a day for the last 3-4 days. I am feeling kinda discouraged after so many days in a row of weight gain. I KNOW its water weight because I cant physically eat enough to have gained all this back, but I am still feeling kind of discouraged. I just emailed my doc to see if I can take some water pills to help get the bloat off. Anyone else experience similar issues this far out?"
Popsicles Count as water?,"RNY - 7/22/19

I know this is a stretch but Iâ€™m continuing to struggle to get much more than 40 oz or so in each day.  Between water and shakes and a little food here and there is seems like something is always going in and I already feel sick most days.

Sometimes I can easily tolerate a sugar free popsicle.

Iâ€™ve read several times about post-surgery advice here and from my doctor that soon after surgery a popsicle can help keep you hydrated.

Well?  Is it like total half-ass water intake?  Does it count at all?

So the bad question is, how much should I have lost after 6 months. I had RNY at 171kg's/377lbs. I am now 136kg's/300lbs. I have 2 weeks to go before my 6 months is up. I will do a full post then on everything. The weight loss I think is good, though the past month my diet has not gone well. My sister was here on holiday and after she left I got sick and I really haven't been as strict with my diet as I was for the first 4 months. The past week I have gotten back on track.

I tried to google how much I should have lost, but there isn't much information on this, with everyone promoting rather concentrating on just being healthy and being fit. The one I did find said that for RNY you should lose 30-40% of your excess body weight. I took this to be my extra weight over what a ""normal"" bmi is for me. A normal BMI puts me at 85kg's/187lbs making my excess bodyweight 86kg's/189lbs. Having lost 35kg's/77lbs so far since surgery day, 35kg's of 86kg's would be 41% of my excess body weight lost so far. 

Does this sound right to you or am I on a totally wrong path? Is 30-40% of excess body weight reasonable/correct for 6 months? Did I work out my excess body weight correct?"
Gut support after RNY,"Hey everyone, just had my rny Tuesday, and it hasnâ€™t been smooth sailing. Gas pain was really terrible

Anywho, wondering if anyone has a good system or suggestion for a way to support the gut when standing. It really pulls on the incisions and limits how much I move around. Iâ€™m experimenting with an ace bandage, but I need something more I think

Thanks!"

1 Month Post Op progress. Sleeved on 4/25/19. SW of 287 after liquid diet. What a roller coaster of feels this has been!,
Liquid pre-op diet,"So I am due to have surgery on the 12th of June, and need to start my liquid pre-op diet anytime between next Monday and next Thursday. My only issue is whether or not I can still drink tea or coffee along with the shakes? Does anyone know? I've asked the medical secretary to the consultant to get an answer but who knows how long that will take!"
Initial consultation,"So, I have my initial consultation on Monday to discuss options for me! I'm so excited and nervous at the same time! Is there anything I need to remember to ask? Thank you :)"
VSG 02/13 questions,Hi yâ€™all! I had VSG last week on 2/13. So far I feel OK but Iâ€™ve got some questions. I have a...cramping sensation sometimes kinda behind the incision that is at the bottom of my sternum. This can be when Iâ€™m drinking or any other time really. Sometimes I burp a little when the cramp happens and sometimes it feels like a trapped air bubble there.  Sometimes it feels like an echo of hunger. Sometimes it leads to a very uncomfortable hiccup. Itâ€™s driving me crazy! Has anyone experienced this and if so what is it? Will it go away when I finally get the gas from surgery out? 
Poor poor poor,Had anyone gotten a loan for bariatric surgery?  My insurance won't cover it.  I'm bummed out.
"Almost there, but still seems so far away.","Last Wednesday I had my final 6 month weight loss appointment. It went well and I had lost some more weight. I have been using the 6 months as a way to get into good habits and mind set for post op. I am one of the first vegan wls patients for my hospital so they ask a lot of questions and follow my journey. They are seeing it become more common and want to be able to provide support for us vegan wls patients as well.

After my appt, I met with the nurse to go over my requirements and schedule the review with my surgeon. I have to get signed off on one more minor thing before that august 14th surgeon appt. No biggie. But then she warned instead of a week to get paperwork ready, its averaging 2 weeks right now. Then the wait for insurance from 2 to 4 weeks. This puts me at approval hopefully by mid September to end of September. Surgeon is out for most of September so surgeries are limited. I'm told to expect surgery in October. I am a little bummed to wait longer but just keep telling myself I have been fat this long, a couple months longer will be fine. 

I apologize for the long spiel. Just needed to get those thoughts and timeline out since I do not have someone who understands those frustrations. Anyone else have a long wait like this after completing everything? Or is this pretty normal and I am just impatient? Lol."

How do you deal with adjusting emotionally?,"Hi all,

I am a 30yo male who has just had lapband surgery a week ago. My weight pre-surgery was 152kg (335pounds), leaving me with severe obstructive sleep apnea, no self-confidence, and depression. My weight has also been a major impactor to my sex life as I literally use anyway to get out of having sex with my partner of 5 years due to how I feel about my body. It has also impacted other areas in my life such as university studies (I had to postpone graduation by a year, since I couldn't do the compulsory feel trip component due to my sleep apnea getting in the way).

Despite all that. I am sitting here one week after surgery.. questioning myself.. asking myself did I do the right thing. Am I going to enjoy my life without all the food I love? (which is silly, because did I really enjoy life before?). It's like my head is attacking me. The thought of never being able to eat out, or drink out with full servings, the thought of never having my beloved pizza to the extent I was having it (sometimes 2 large pizzas in one sitting). I know it's ridiculous, but that is just the things running through my head.

I realise more and more that I was basing my life around food. It was giving my life meaning and masking the emptyness I feel in other areas of my life. Since I was a child, food has been more than about fulfilling energy/nutrient requirements, it has been a reward, a comfort, a joy, something to fill in the day.

So I just wonder how those who have had surgery deal with this? Obviously the simple answer would be therapy, but I wonder if anyone has experience with other methods like meditation? Or did you make an emotional adjustment as the weeks rolled on and the weight started dropping?

Thankfully, the lapband has been great so far. No real side effects. Overnight I went cold turkey on my food, soda, and with that copius amounts of sugar and caffeine. I have been able to stick it out with ease, even with stuff like chocolate sitting in the pantry. I just need to get my head fully behind this. I feel like I am mourning a life I wasn't even living. I wonder if it is the fact that I have been overweight/obese all my teenage and adult life, so the benefits of being a healthy weight just aren't registering as they should. 

Sorry is this is a bit rambling,

Pre-op shake timing?,"Hey all. Iâ€™ve reached initiation. This is day one of 13 where my pre-op diet requires me to drink 4 protein shakes, 64oz of water, and sugar free popsicles as desired. Day 14 is clear liquids only, no shakes.

Iâ€™m on shake number two and I already feel like crap. Itâ€™s not that Iâ€™m hungry. These shakes give me 200 calories and 27g protein. Iâ€™m feeling weak and irritable. Itâ€™s too soon for this!

Is it best to drink the whole shake quickly-ish rather than nursing it for 30-60 minutes? I find them to be very sweet, and Iâ€™m mixing them with 16oz of water each. Otherwise theyâ€™re chalky and I find clumps of powder in them. Also, should I be giving my body time to process the shakes before I start drinking water? I fee like thatâ€™s probably a thing. Just looking for a method that will help me feel as functional as possible.

Also, did anyone else walk or work out while on pre-op liquid diet? I donâ€™t want to make myself feel worse."

A vent/rant whatever,"I have my last nutritionist visit on August 21st and Iâ€™ve been riding the high that Iâ€™m doing really well with the occasional slip up. I have a lot going on at home, full time taking care of my father who is essentially a 300lb baby, unable to walk and do much of anything. I also am a full time teacher prepping for the school year. My sisters donâ€™t do jack shit to help out, so its me and my mom. My dad tends to wear us out quickly, with mundane requests and doing stupid shit like transferring to his wheelchair unsupervised (he had a bad fall last week) so anyways itâ€™s a very stressful time but whatever Iâ€™m dealing with it. 

So Iâ€™m looking at my food log and Iâ€™m realizing that no, Iâ€™m not doing that great. Iâ€™m still losing the weight, but Iâ€™m not making healthy choices or following the suggestions that the nutritionist has made for me 100%. And I got so pissed last night. Like why the fuck do we have a tendency to sabotage ourselves? Iâ€™m down 36 lbs. I havenâ€™t lost that weight in like 7 years. I havenâ€™t gained since Iâ€™ve started this journey and I recognize and accept that this is so fucking hard. But some days Iâ€™m like if I look at another piece of chicken or vegetables Iâ€™m gunna choke on it. UGH. Just need help pushing through or reassurance that Iâ€™m not fucking it all up."

Food/recipe ideas 2 months post op vsg,"People on this redditpost rightfully told me off about the foods I currently eat. Because in this country, they are not specific at all about what you can and cannot eat. The rule is basically ""try everything and eat everything"". But I notice that i get really sick from that.

I live on my own, btw. So cooking big meals is a problem."

In search of protein shakes,"Hello. I'm a couple of weeks away from receiving my surgery date and I am looking into protein shakes. I decided to try some out before surgery as I am lactose intolerant and also have IBS.

I have already tried premier protein and of course it didnt go so well. Severe abdominal pain and massive cramps, even some diarrhea. 

I am hoping you guys can help me find some better alternatives. Thank you so much for all your help.

FYI I am in Ontario, Canada."
Has anyone been hospitalized for depression prior to surgery?,"And if so, did you have to wait to get surgery?

I'm going through a major depression. My boyfriend thinks I should be hospitalized and I guess I do too since I cry every day all day and that's probably not normal.

However I remember the snooty psychologist I was required to see at the weight center ask me if I had been hospitalized for depression and I said no. And she said good because patients who have been hospitalized in the past year(or two, can't remember) couldn't get the surgery. But, in not giving up on this surgery. I'm so close to having it. I've been waiting almost a year."
Instant cream of wheat vs stovetop after surgery,"Hi,

On the list of foods we got approved to eat after leaving the hospital was cream of wheat. Is it okay that I did microwave instant cream of wheat thinned out with lactaid 0% fat milk?

Lactose Problems after WLS?,"Has anyone else developed problems with lactose after WLS? I'm two years post-op and have noticed my usual breakfast of yogurt &amp; cottage cheese is just not working anymore. (Usually Dannon Light &amp; Fit Greek, with 1/4 cup cottage cheese) I picked that because it's easy, it's cool, quick, high protein, etc. It's been a good plan so far but lately I'm getting a feeling of vague nausea and heaviness and just ickiness after eating it. Not sure if it's the heat of summer, or if I'm developing lactose intolerance. Anybody else have any ideas? Thanks!"

VSG 06/24/19 - Three weeks out HW:440 CW:370,"I started at 440 and dropped 50lbs during 3 week pre-op diet, and 20lbs since surgery. Had my surgery about 3 weeks ago and I feel like Iâ€™ve fully recovered. No pain, I can walk and do other things perfectly fine. I began to eat soft foods at 2 weeks, Iâ€™ve mostly done chicken, turkey, egg, some fruits, oatmeal. I do eat way less, see noticeable difference in appearance and ability (maybe someday Iâ€™ll be brave enough to post a pic). My weight has currently stalled, and I wonder what if I donâ€™t keep dropping? I know Iâ€™m impatient and probably exaggerating but I donâ€™t feel like I have limitations.

I am also one year out from having knee replacement, and feel that my recovery has been hampered by my weight. 
I am considering the sleeve surgery. One of my many concerns, and the one I would probably struggle with the most would be loss of streangth. I am a strong guy and I like being a strong guy.  
I was hoping some others out there could share their expectations with muscle loss and or how they countered it after surgery.

Must I Confess?,"I fasted all last week, but took a break from my pre-op fast this weekend because I was told my surgery date was being pushed back.

3 weeks Post Op - Meal size concern,"Hello All,

I am in my 3rd week of post-op and have been instructed by doc to graduate from puree to soft texture food (some veggies and cheeses, etc). My concern is that I am still not overcoming the liquid stage. My typical diet is mostly liquids (water, water..and water). I will mix Genepro (unflavored protein) in water and drink, maybe some soup once in a while. I do take my meds regularly and meet my liquid goals. I have been out for socials over the weekend and had some soup or so, but cannot go beyond 3-4oz. I did push a few times..and BOY that was a mistake. I clocked at least 2 hrs of extreme discomfort before it got back to normal (foamies etc). This limited meal size is getting frustrating when it comes to planning meals. 

Will my appetite/meal size improve in the future? If so, what timelines have people see that happen over? Thank you."

My One Week Post Op Story,"Today is one week since I had my operation. What a roller coaster of a ride it has been.

On the day of the op (last Tuesday) I was 3rd on the list. Only went down to surgery at 11.  Did not like the wait and would have preferred to be first just to get it over and done with. 

After getting the sedative to go under, it was like a blink of the eye before I woke up again. Waking up was one of the worst experiences I could imagine. I felt like I was in Vietnam laying on the battlefield with my guts blown open. Not painful, but I really thought that was where I was. This only lasted for a short while, until the groggy feeling left me. 

They took me right back to the general ward, which was a good indicator and they said everything went well. I was surprised how small the holes are for the surgery.

That night I had to go to the bathroom. Managed to get up fine and walk there. The pee was BLUE! I freaked out a little until the nurse told me it is the die they put in me to check for leaks.

I also farted, a lot! which the doctor told me was really good for so early after the operation as it is a good sign that all the pipes are sealed and working. Farting and burping is apparently a way of life for a while after op. Walking does seem to alleviate it.

I stayed over night on the Wednesday. Medical aid approves you to stay until the Friday if needed. However the doctor was really happy with my progress on the Thursday morning so I went home.

Thursday to Sunday I was healing and feeling a little better each day. I was not feeling 100% though, really run down. I could not sleep well at all. Any sleep I had gave me really vivid and odd dreams, like I was in them for days. Woke up and it was maybe 2 hours, but felt like I got none.

The painkillers they gave are a funny part. I have bad back pain when I sleep. I have been on a pain killer for the past 5 years, at least 2 tablets every night before sleep. Part of the reason I wanted the op was to help me get off these pills. So of course, the painkillers they give me are the same ones! I know ulcers are a problem now, but I had to take 2 just to get any sleep. I tried the one night not to take any, but that was a disaster. I guess I am only going to get off them once I lose actual weight. Good news is I am off my blood pressure meds!

Anyway, during those 4 days I was just trying to get my liquids in. I never stocked the fridge before going for the op but I had some basics to get me going. I re-read the diet that was given to me for post op and there were a ton more things on there that I should have been having! So I went shopping and brought a whole bunch of stuff.

Monday was a revelation. First, I had my first poop that morning! I felt so proud. I also got way more actual ""food"" into me instead of just water, tea and cup of soup which I pretty much replaced all my ""meals"" with the prior four days. Stick to the diet you are given post operation! It is actually pretty good if you do it as they say. I felt full and had the ""satisfied"" feeling that I used to have after a good meal pre op. Monday night I had my first good nights sleep. I don't know if it was because of the food or if my body has healed to the point where its ok now. All I can say is as I am writing this I am feeling a ton better. Well rested and well  fed.

Past 2 days I have been learning new stuff as well that a lot of people mention. Your meals is basically one long, all day, meal. Just sipping something over an hour, then getting something else to sip over the next hour. On and on it goes. I have also learned that sticking to the diet is hard. I feel full a lot of the time. The small amount that you get over an hour, if its the right stuff, makes you stuffed. At times I will just move to water for an hour to give myself a rest. But always be sipping. I have also learned how much of a sip is too much. There is an uncomfortable feeling you get as it goes down, it's not pleasant. 

I also just received my first shipment of vitamins. WTF! There are so many. A sachet of some drink and 2 tablets in the morning. One tablet in the evening. On tablet to be taken a week. An injection that I have to give myself every 4 months. It is a little overwhelming. I also want to find out, how long can I last without these. Not that I plan to not take them, but what happens in a crises and I can't get my stuff. I have calmed down some. After all, I was taking my blood pressure and back pain meds every day. This is mostly just replacing that.

It hasn't all been roses. After the op until Sunday I was (still am a little) feeling very depressed and a lot of regret. I couldn't believe I had actually done this to myself. I just let people rip my insides out. Am I such a loser that I had to get this done? I was sure I could do this by myself, but OMG it's too late now. This is for the rest of my life! I was/am angry with myself. I got the op because I just turned 40 and thought I am not going to live another 5 years if I don't get this done. But  wouldn't the thought of going through something so drastic make me rethink things and try one more time? In conjunction with feeding myself properly and remembering all the times I did try, but ultimately went back to my old ways, this was the last resort for me. I have been fat all my life. Tried everything. Succeeded a lot of times, but never long term. This was forcing me into a corner that I never wanted and don't want to be in. But in the long run it will allow me to have a better life. I have to believe this.

That is my story so far. This has been really therapeutic to write. This community has been amazing. I don't always post, but I am always here reading. The words of encouragement and information is really helpful. I look forward to a one month update with pics maybe :) .

Hunger feeling to hunger pain?,"Iâ€™ve talked to another person in this group, she actually brought it up and it got me wondering.

Does this eventually normalize back to the â€œfull feelingâ€ or is just the new norm?"
Questions about going from chewables to regular vitamins.,"I am a year and a half out now from my surgery and don't want to keep doing the chewables for my multi and calcium.  For those who have made this switch, how did the switch go for you?  during labs and checks ups, did you find that you were still absorbing everything you needed?  Or do you have to take even more?

&amp;#x200B;

The calcium that i am looking at is 6 tablets a serving/a day.   Can this be broken up throughout the day or dose it have to be taken all at once?  Multi vit. is 2 a day, and I would most likely want to split that up as well, to be able to spread out the absorption of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Any hints, tips or suggestions?"
Gallbladder and â€œweight gainâ€,"I just got my gallbladder out yesterday, 6 months after VSG. Iâ€™m down 70 pounds, with (maybe) 20 to go. I was full of stones and it was my second attack since I got my sleeve done. 

I made sure to weigh myself the morning of surgery and the morning after, just to see how much â€œweightâ€ I put on. Well, I gained 8 pounds from swelling! I only got 1 liter of fluids via IV when I was at the hospital, so itâ€™s not like I was super loaded with fluids. 

So for those who worry about â€œnot loosing weightâ€ or stalling immediately after they get their gastric sleeve or RNY, just know that your body *will* hold on to fluids from swelling as well! Trust the process and be patient with yourself â˜ºï¸.

(Weirdly enough, the gas pains are MUCH worse this time around. Theyâ€™re settling in my neck!)"
Car trip a week and a half after rny?,"Would you have been up for about a 2.5 hour car trip, each way, with a few doctorâ€™s appointments/interviews in between about a week and a half after rny? My every three month gastroenterology appointment and research study is on the 18th, and my surgery is on the 9th. Iâ€™d rather not reschedule, since he books four to five months out, at least."
ByPass or Sleeve,"My roommate had a bypass ten years ago and has kept all the weight off.  I am scheduled for a sleeve in two months, but my roommate and mother are discouraging me, saying that many people who do sleeves gain back all their weight after about five years.  Does anyone have any success or failure stories regarding the sleeve to relate?  Or advice?"
"Iâ€™m on Day 4 of my two-week pre-op diet (surgery is 2/25), and itâ€™s taking every ounce of me to not do a late-night binge.","I need to remember all the great work Iâ€™ve done in the last few days and that I canâ€™t let me addiction win when Iâ€™m SO close to changing my life. 

The monster inside keeps saying, â€œbut itâ€™s the LAST time. Let yourself have one more before you canâ€™t have it EVER!â€ I just have to shove that monster in her closet.

I even told myself I could snack on celery. But I knew if I did that, Iâ€™d want peanut butter. And then Iâ€™d spiral until I was neck-deep in a bowl of buttery popcorn.

So Iâ€™m going to lay in bed until Iâ€™m tired and hopefully sleep better than I have in a while.

Iâ€™m sure some of you can relate. Just wanted to tell people who would understand."
Feeling stuck,"Hello. So I have been advised by my SO to join this group. I am one month post op. I am a 28 yr Old and I canâ€™t help but feel stuck. I had the surgery after two years, I never thought this was a short cut or the â€œeasy way outâ€ but rather my little helper. Now I do have PCOS, for those that donâ€™t know what that is itâ€™s basically a hormone disorder that has a lot of other things with it, so Iâ€™m trying to make the best out of my situation but I feel like Iâ€™m stuck at my current weight and although Iâ€™ve lost about 40 lbs I canâ€™t seem to lose anything else Iâ€™ve actually gained 2 lbs and itâ€™s discouraged me in many way. I never get hungry I force myself to eat atleast 3-4times a day and I am nearing my protein goal of 50-60 but thatâ€™s thanks to the protein shakes I drink. I walk ALOT during the day while at work and I do some light leg and arm workouts at home, itâ€™s what Iâ€™m allowed to do for now, I guess Iâ€™m just hoping someone can help me out and give me a suggestion or any tips to help me in my journey no one in my family understands my current lifestyle and Iâ€™ve made peace with that but I donâ€™t know what to do. I just want some help in trying to get over this little hump or even what apps or food recipes I can try to help with eating actual food. Idk anything from advice, guidance but please I canâ€™t hear anymore of the â€œhang in there it will get betterâ€ I know it will but right now I feel a little lost and discouraged and Iâ€™m starting to feel like Iâ€™m the only one with this problem when Iâ€™m positive Iâ€™m not. Thanks for reading if you got this far."
OK... I play. Facegain Friday. 115 lbs difference (Surgery 12 month ago),
Insurance coverage changed- Bariatric surgery no longer included,"July 2018 - I researched WLS and checked if my (future) insurance covered it.(Wasn't enrolled at the time as school wasn't in session) At the time UPMC did cover bariatric procedures.

Sept 2018 I started the weight loss program

Sept-February 2019- I completed all my weigh-ins, sleep study, blood, heart testing, and psychiatrists appointments.

March 2019- Insurance company initially said I wasn't covered. After a discussion with the surgeons admin team, the accepted my claim but rejected me for coverage siting my starting weight, so non-compliance. (My bad)

April 2019- in an extended weigh-in, I was 6lbs lighter than my goal

Today- Surgeon's office said the insurance company said I wasn't covered. I checked my plan again. I couldn't find bariatric surgery. I knew I saw it back in July. I looked at those words everyday leading up to my first meeting

&amp;#x200B;

I checked a document called ""Benefit Modification Rider"" which has a lot of technical language about reasons for being dropped from coverage...but also a list of procedures no longer included. Among them bariatric surgery. 

&amp;#x200B;

I 

AM

DEVISTATED

&amp;#x200B;

I spent 7 months of work plus 3 months of anticipation and research....for nothing. The procedure costs 16k. I don't have that money and I don't even know if I'll have a job by September. Even if I get a job, I don't know if they'll offer insurance or bariatric surgery. So I'm crying and typing this.  I'm incredibly mad at the time spent riding my bike and weighing my food and going to a ridiculous amount of doctors appointments-  instead of fully focusing on writing my dissertation. I feel robbed. I really wanted to get the surgery and show up 20 or 30 lbs lighter to my defense in the fall.   


For anyone who has been in a similar situation, what did you do?  My immediate knee-jerk reaction is to get the procedure done in Mexico, but I realize it would be irresponsible to use my savings when I don't have job security. If I get another insurance plan, can I still use my participation in this weight program? Is my work transferable? I'm afraid I'll start gaining again. I'm so hungry and lethargic from the strict exercise. I know my weight it going to either creep back up or I'm going to restrict myself into insanity. Weight maintenance has never been a reality for me.  


The real kick-in-the-teeth is today I have a sleep specialist appointment for my CPAP machine (that I hardly need) so that I can show the insurance company that I am being compliant with all the medical suggestions as a result of all this testing. If I don't go to the appointment, I'll have to pay for the machine out of pocket. I still have to do bariatric related stuff today knowing I cannot get approval. I hope I can stop crying long enough to be in public."
Pain six weeks after VSG ... normal?,"Happy New Year everyone!

I had the VSG and one stitch on a hiatal hernia repair on 11/20 ... six weeks ago.  On the weight loss end I am doing well.  However, I am having issues with the hernia repair.  Drinking is not an issue but anything else is, even soft scrambled eggs.  I eat small bites but I get pain in the hiatal hernia repair area ... seems to be getting worse where I am wincing  from the temporary pain.  Mostly still on soft food/full liquid because of it.  Weight control center says it will pass but hard to believe right now.  Anyone else experience this so long after?  Did it go away?  Thanks ahead of time."
Today is my initial surgical consultation. What should I remember to ask?,"Hi guys.  I need your help.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been ready to do this for a while, and finally today is my first consultation with the surgeon for the Sleeve Gastrectomy.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm certain that there are plenty of questions I haven't thought of to ask him, or other members of his team.  Can you guys help me out and throw out some questions I may want to ask?  I'm nervous as hell about this, but I'm determined to see this through.

Question for the veggie folks,"I was sleeved 12/18/18 and have had slow but steady results with basically sticking to 800 kcals and focusing on protein.  Iâ€™ve had a handful of family members die in the past year from completely out-of-the-blue horrible, aggressive cancers that have really made me start thinking about what Iâ€™m putting in my body beyond just what will help me lose weight best.

Iâ€™ve been a lacto-ovo vegetarian in the past but switched to omni post-surgery to help with protein intake and to make it easy to find things to eat since Iâ€™m on the road a lot.  I donâ€™t like meat, though, and am fine with cutting it out of my diet in favor of plant proteins. 

Since this whole cancer thing has kind of shocked my family, Iâ€™ve considered going fully vegan, which Iâ€™ve never had much luck with in the past. I always felt kind of run down nutritionally and stressed out about finding high quality food on the road or in the grocery store of my rural town.  Iâ€™d like to try again, though, and wanted to get advice from any vegetarians/vegans on what your macros are, whether you think eggs and dairy are necessary to hit protein, and any other tips you might have.  Thanks in advance!"
Bipolar and WLS,Any other mentally interesting peeps get WLS? Iâ€™m going through the qualification and application process but wondering if my brain cooties (anxiety/panic/bipolar) may stand in the way.
Took off-brand excedrin w/out realizing- sick and dizzy after,It was off brand at work and I didnâ€™t even think about it. Iâ€™ve been super dizzy all day since and just feeling jittery. Could this be related?
"Hey everyone, just had the talk with my doctor about getting WLS, he tried referring me to a dietitian/nutritionist but insurance wants me to be diabetic for it to be covered, but theyâ€™ll pay for surgery.",Quite a funny world we live in...
[Question]Working out and calorie intake,"Hey guys, I am 6 months post OP. 

I am quite skinny after my wls and I am very happy and have 0 regrets about my surgery. Though I became really weak. Like I have trouble lifting up 3-4 laptops at the same time and I will be sore in my muscles the next day. I been thinking about going to the gym and start building muscle and eventually become ''lean''. 

I've read that if you go to the gym you will need to eat more calories since working out and building muscle requires to eat more calories to 'heal' your muscles again. My question is, what happens if I up my calories and stick to the workout. Will I screw my stomach up if I up my calories? Will I gain weight(fat) again if I do this?"
How soon did you start exercising after surgery?,"I was sleeved on 12/29. I've been healing very quickly and I don't feel fatigued anymore. I have my first post op appointment in 2 days but i wanted to get other people's experience with starting exercise after surgery. 

With my current job situation, I'm at home a majority of the time and it's super boring. Before surgery, I would go to the gym when I was super bored and had absolutely nothing to do. I know right now I'm not supposed to be lifting but I wanted to try walking on the treadmill, cycling, crosstrainer/elliptical, really just anything to get me out of the house and back in the gym. 

So, when did you start exercising? And when did you start weightlifting, if you did?

Note: I plan on asking my doctor at my appointment when I can start exercising again."
Did your surgeon estimate how much weight you'd loose?,"I've had various people familiar with the Bariatric surgery process ask me how much I'm estimated to loose.  My surgeon did not broach the subject and no one in the program has even brought it up.

&amp;#x200B;

What's the deal?  And how do they ""guess""?"
Feeling ill after every meal (about 1 month post op),"Hey everyone! 

Iâ€™m 32 days out from surgery (VSG). Two days ago I went back to eating solid foods thinking the hard part was over. However, I was wrong: getting back on solids has been really hard. I have felt ill after every single meal. 

I often throw up, feel bloated and nauseated. Iâ€™m not sure what Iâ€™m doing wrong. I eat very slowly, stick to the foods cleared by my doctor, chew about 50 times before swallowing (Iâ€™m actually counting) and still feel sick. 

Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m not meeting my protein goals because Iâ€™ve been avoiding eating... Which I probably shouldnâ€™t do. But I hate feeling sick. 

I have a doctorâ€™s appointment but itâ€™s not for another couple of weeks, so in the meantime, Iâ€™d like to know if anyone else went through this. 

Thanks in advance for any advice :) "
Pain in the butt,Since I've lost over 100lbs I've been having a difficult time with sitting. I think I lost all my cushioning and my backside gets very sore lol.  Anyone experience this or have any suggestions? Cushions and good posture help to prolong the time I can sit without pain but I'm looking to fix the problem. Do I just need to do squats and booty workouts? 
First night back to work and it royally sucks.,"My doctor gave me two weeks off of work on my FMLA paperwork. That means that I went back to work last night. The discharge paperwork from the hospital said that I cannot go back to work for four weeks, and only part-time then. So, here I am, working nights at post op day 20, feeling horrible and nauseated... This part sucks. I was feeling ok at home but work is not very good for this major recovery experience."
Childcare and driving recovery time.,"I know this has been asked before but u can't find it, so bear with me. 

Im pre-op, hoping for surgery in April, and starting to get my ducks in a row for recovery. As far as childcare goes, should I expect to need any help?  My kids are 3 and 6, so there's not much lifting anymore. They're in preschool and daycare during the day, but my husband works nights so it's just the three of us for the evenings.  How soon will I be able to actively watch them - basically just sitting on the couch with them, but also able to get up to get them things, cook a dinner for them, and get them in bed?  Im trying to figure out if we'll need any help at all. In my mind I should be fine to do this a couple of days after surgery, but am I expecting too much?

Also how soon after surgery can you drive?  I'd need to be able to pick them up from school, do I need to make arrangements to have someone else do this for a bit?

Thanks!!"
Got my vgs date 11/7,"Got the all clear yesterday after all the pre op stuff is finally done and Iâ€™m in for the 11/7/19 in Melbourne Australia. I have a blood clotting disorder that was uncovered in pre surgery blood tests and Iâ€™ll have to give myself daily injections for the month post surgery but Iâ€™m glad they found it.
Pre op diet is actually surprisingly easy after the first 2 days. I have 23 days to go, Iâ€™m excited but nervous. I stopped diet soft drink about a month ago and started going to the gym at the drs recommendation. My official start weight is 132kg (291 pounds) and itâ€™s so embarrassing to me but atleast Iâ€™m on the right track to do something about it. 
So ready for this complete change to my life."
Optifast recipe suggestions?,"I start my pre op diet tomorrow. It's specifically  2 Optifast products a day, at least 2 cups of allowed veggies and some oil for 2 weeks. 

Any recipe suggestions with the allowed veggies? I'm realllllly not looking forward to the optifast products and hoping to keep it pleasant with some nice recipes!"
Stalls suck,"Just venting, been stalled for two weeks about. I'm doing everything right I think, I have an appointment with my dietitian in a couple of weeks, which she can point out if I'm f-ing up.   


So in the immortal words of Sir Winston Churchill, I will just have to KBO. Keep buggering on.

How are you doing WLS peeps?"
3 days until surgery and 3 days until a fresh start.,
Uncomfortable positions during sleep,"Hello everyone.

I had a DS procedure done on 2/5 with the removal of gastric banding. My surgeon had removed my gall bladder as well as my appendix to prevent complications from arising later on. I have a midline cut from xiphoid process (tip on end of sternum) to the bottom of my belly button.
I am a side and stomach sleeper. It has been super rough trying to get some sleep and I am still very sore. Does anyone know how long it'll take for me to be able to sleep on my side or stomach? Sometimes if I lay on my back, it feels like my intestines are freely moving around then I get a case of nausea.

Please help. :-("
10 weeks out - almost constant nausea and diarrhoea,"Hi all,

I had an RNY about 10 weeks ago but struggling daily with severe nausea, mostly after eating but sometimes without eating and it's really getting to me.

Almost all of my bowel movements are loose and I often get painful cramps and have to rush to the bathroom. It makes going out in public stressful.

Does anyone have any advice or suggestions? I take ginger tablets sometimes and sometimes the help but sometimes not. Should I see my doctor? I'm based in the UK."
How many ounces can you eat in one sitting?,"I am almost 8 months out and just did another â€œsleeve testâ€ to see how much my stomach can hold in one meal. I used chicken breast and found I can only fit in 2.5 ounces (72 grams). 

I have a very tight restriction. The program I work with doesnâ€™t want me to eat more than 3 times a day, but I have to with that much of a restriction! If I ate like they said Iâ€™d probably only get in 400 calories a day. Iâ€™m only 8 pounds away from my (new) goal of 145. I may eventually shoot for 135 depending on how I look/feel. (Iâ€™m 5â€™5 for reference).

I know this is a good thing to complain about lol, but I worry about getting up to maintenance amounts of food when the time comes.

How far out are you and whatâ€™s our restriction?"
Dessert milk recipe success!ï¿½ï¿½,"I made a protein milk dessert drink... I haven't given it a name yet. Its similar in flavor to an Indian dessert called Kheer, made with spices rice and milk. But basically a non-dairy Spiced Protein Milk!!! Try it! It's goodï¿½ï¿½

Sooo I'm terrible at writing down recipes for my creations... but if you're good in the kitchen its simple enough to throw together. 

Unsweetened Almond milk
Unflavored protein powder of your choice
Very little butter for sauteing spices.
Vanilla extract
2x packets Stevia
Cardamom
Cinnamon stick, maybe a quarter or less.
Allspice, just break off a small piece of it.

Ok so saute spices lightly in butter
Add aprox 3 cups almond milk, get hot but not boiling.
Add stevia and a few drops of vanilla extract.
When it's almost boiling turn off heat.
Mix in protein powder. Aprox 1/2 scoop.
Remove from heat and cool. 
The longer it sits,  the stronger the flavor will be.

I strained off the large spice chunks after 4 hours. But over night would be fine.

Drink warm or chilled. The spices are so tasty and cover the flavor of the protein powder. 
It reminds me of my favorite Indian Dessert, and it's just sweet enough to satisfy that craving!"
Is this real life?,"I had VSG on 4/24 and I am officially 35lbs down even with a 2.5 week stall and now the weight is just falling off again! 

&amp;#x200B;

I've spent every bleeding day of my life either suffering through a diet, planning my next diet or feeling terrible amounts of shame for not being on a diet. VSG is a godsend. It would have taken me months of self hatred and starvation to lose 35lbs. Surgery is definitely not the easy way out, but wow does it work."
How long did it take for all of the gas to go away after your sleeve?,"I had my sleeve done on Wednesday, and the main pain I have is all of the gases bubbling around when I do something like stand up or drink. I've been walking around to get it out, and I've burped some and have just now started farting, but am wondering how long it may generally take to all dissipate. Thanks so much!"
"For those who had RnY, when could you drive after surgery?",
Gallbladder issues post-op?,"I had my sleeve done 11 months ago. Two
Weeks ago I developed pain on my right side near the bottom of my ribs. Lasted two day and spread to my breastbone and center chest. Went to the er for fear of infection or heart attack as I know they can present oddly in women. Had all the tests and they ended up diagnosing just infection/inflammation of the esophagus. Went home pain resolved in a few more days. Yesterday the pain is back. Same spot. Constant pressing pain. Not horrible maybe a 3/10. But itâ€™s starting to radiate to my chest again. I had a ct scan done at the er they were checking for ulcer or issues with my stomach but Iâ€™d think they would have noticed a gallbladder issue. They noticed a problem with my iud and mentioned that. Anyone else have gallbladder issues post op?"
Finally post op!,"Hey everyone!!! I had my surgery this morning at 11am. Everything went amazing and I've been having an amazing recovery. I haven't vomited or had a great deal of pain at all. I've been walking around like a crazy lady so much and sipping my water. I'm so happy and relieved. If your surgery is coming up don't be nervous! Go in with a positive attitude! 

Much love,

C"
What did you wear on the day of your surgery?,
TMI question regarding menstruation right after surgery,"So I am two weeks post op today, and I have been on my period since day 5 post op.

I fully expected this to happen, but Iâ€™m curious to know if yaâ€™ll had a regular period or did you experience something heavier?

Itâ€™s been over a week for me and Iâ€™ve noticed my flow has gotten heavier and I wonder if I should just go with it or be concerned. 

Thanks for your input!"
Stitch in upper left side,"I have this uncomfortable stitch in my upper left side, kind if like when you run in gym class and get that side discomfort. It started last night while at Walmart and has been bothering me since. I can't lay on my left side. Any idea what this is? Should I call the nurse's line?"
Camping 5.5 Weeks Post-Op?,"I originally thought I would have my surgery in March but it's been pushed back until May 13th. About five and half weeks later is my kids' daycare's annual camping trip which I would LOVE to go on. From the perspectives of those who have had surgery, is that too soon to go camping? We'll be car camping with no real hiking (because 2 year olds) but we'll be far away from any stores. I assume I'll be bringing soft foods in a cooler with a ton of ice to last the 2 nights. Any feedback you all have will be greatly appreciated!"
Questions for first appt.,Hi everyone. Iâ€™m VERY new to my WLS journey. Iâ€™m still exploring all options but I have a consultation with a doctor this Weds. Iâ€™ve been googling but would love to hear from everyone whoâ€™s been through it - are there any specific questions you would recommend I make sure to ask? (I know under my insurance with my BMI I qualify for the surgery). 
Schedule,"This might be kinda stupid, but Iâ€™m finding it a real struggle to get all my meals, proteins, and liquids in. Plus, take all of my meds on time. Then, itâ€™s like ok I just drank, but Iâ€™m hungry so now I have to wait a half an hour to eat then eat for a half an hour then another half an hour later I can drink again...AHHH! I donâ€™t even work! How do all of you do it? Are there any tricks or good apps that help keep you on track? Do you write out a schedule? Meal prep? "
Skin removal surgery,"I have an appointment with a plastic surgeon on Monday to talk about removing excess skin.   I am considering getting everything done... legs, butt, stomach, arms, moob removal, and neck lift but only have $25-30k I can spend.

Does anyone have any advice on questions to ask? "
Got sleeved 5/29!!,I already feel this has been the best decision I've made in so long! I was home after a one night stay at the hospital. I ended up with 6 incisions due to my liver but each one has already closed up 90% and aren't really a bother. There was so much gas and the walking helped so much. Stairs and lying on my stomach really helped get the last bits out! If you are debating getting wls I highly recommend it! I went into surgery at 296 lbs and I weighed in this morning at 284 lbs. I'm already finding myself sleeping better and feeling better! If anyone has any questions about it ask away!!:)
To debt or not to debt;,"I just have to attend my nutritional group meeting tomorrow (6/5)  and have my results from my psych appointment faxed over to my doctors office before they will submit to my insurance for approval.

Iâ€™m basically at the final stretch before scheduling my surgery. 

My husband and I are making our bills with not much swinging room at the moment. My energy levels with being this obese are minimum- not to mention I have Hashimoto thyroid disease and PCOS. 

My plan is to take the entire time off work for recovery (up to 6 weeks) and take a small loan from my 401k to make my bills through the recovery period. Then I will make small payments towards the surgery until it is paid off. 

I work a very high stress job, where I am on my feet 100% of my shift (besides my breaks) my job includes fast paced walking, bending, lifting, and squatting. This is why I need the whole time to recover. 

Iâ€™m starting to feel some guilt that this is selfish of me to put my family on more of a financial strain by having this procedure. But if I donâ€™t get this weight off my health will only continue to decline and I will become a huge financial burden. 

I canâ€™t take out any loans due to my debt to income ratio. Student loans, house and car payments.

Am I being selfish here? Or is self care selfless in this situation? Any opinions/advice is welcome.

"Pre-op, how did you convince yourself you could be successful?","Iâ€™m in the earliest stages of this process. (You know, obsessively googling, following people on Instagram, etc.) I have an appointment for a consultation with a surgeon next week to find out itâ€™s even an option for me, but I suspect it will be. Iâ€™m 40F, 260 lbs, 5â€™3â€, very healthy other than obesity. 

Iâ€™ve been overweight my whole life and obese my entire adult life. About ten years ago, I joined WW and lost around 40 lbs, down to around 225. Also, I started running. It took probably a year to successfully get through C25K. Then I did a 10K, and then started training for a half marathon. I couldnâ€™t both diet and run long distance, so I started basically eating what I wanted and running a lot. My weight was stable for a few years at 220-ish, and I was really active and did several half marathons. Eventually I decided to try a full marathon. I did that in late 2014, but in the process, I developed plantar fasciitis and really bad IT band syndrome that ended up requiring PT. It was totally because I was running too much with too much extra weight. 

While sidelined, I ended up putting on weight till I got up around 280, then strictly dieting for several months and getting down to 245, then kind of... giving up? I think itâ€™s just finally become very apparent to me that even years of diligent dieting and exercise is never going to get me out of obesity. 

The thing is, in other areas of my life, Iâ€™m not a failure. My relationships are healthy, Iâ€™m reasonably successful in my career, Iâ€™m a single parent but I feel like Iâ€™m doing a decent job keeping all the balls in the air. Iâ€™m not BeyoncÃ©, but I generally am doing ok and even occasionally great. But weight? No matter how hard Iâ€™ve tried, nothing has been long term successful. I ran a full marathon while obese... and it didnâ€™t really help. So emotionally, Iâ€™m just scared. Am I actually just lazy and the Gatorade I drank after long runs is why Iâ€™m still fat? Do I lack what it takes? 

I will fully admit that I emotionally eat. I donâ€™t binge eat, but Iâ€™ve put on the weight by saying, â€œthis was a long day, letâ€™s get ice cream.â€ That said, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever eaten a pint of ice cream all in one day. My portions arenâ€™t wildly inappropriate now, but if Iâ€™m not severely restricting, Iâ€™ll gain. Is this a sign that I lack the necessarily discipline to be successful long term after WLS? Or were you guys also dealing with less than perfect eating habits before? I just feel like... whatâ€™s the point of a severely restrictive diet if it just doesnâ€™t work or feel sustainable? So then I allow too many treats. Was WLS the tool you needed to get past the â€œwhatâ€™s the pointâ€ feelings, because instead of staying stalled while obese, you were making progress? Or is my history of eating too many chips and queso after a long day pretty much an indication that Iâ€™m doomed?"
Bringing protein shakes on plane,"I'm going to be flying in a little bit and curious about bringing protein shakes through security at the airport (I'm in the US, domestic flight). Are they considered medically necessary?  Do I need documentation saying I had wls?  I know I can bring powder but the only protein shake I can tolerate is the Fairlife, which only comes in pre-mixed bottles. They're also hard to find so I'd rather not try to find them at my destination. I'm only going for two days and don't want to have to check a bag if I don't have to."
Isopure protein,"Hi everyone!

I'm scheduled to get RNY on 2/25 and I'm on the liquid diet. I'm bouncing around between Premier Protein, Pure Protein and just started trying out Isopure. I'm finding my taste buds are adjusting to the liquid diet and some days Pure Protein/Premier is too sweet and other times the after taste makes me gag.

I've been thinking about mixing Isopure flavored powders to get a different flavor, i.e. chocolate and banana cream. Has anyone tried this? They're expensive so I really don't want to waste a serving if I can help it. TIA!!"
8 days before surgery,"I have a PASE appointment today, 8 days before surgery..Iâ€™m excited for it to be over but also excited to see how things go. What life is going to be like post surgery

Filling out the form about if I die on the table was a little harrowing though. 

Iâ€™ll post a before and after in March after 30 days post surgery to see how if any results look like "

He cant eat bread because it gets stuck in his tjroat or something. He seema to be able to eat certain things that are less ""fluffy"" like those little bite coffee cake things.

How strict are the guidelines?,"I got my info packet today and I'm a wee scared. They have said I need to be smoke free (I vape) and I have to give up coffee.

Beginning my Gastric Bypass journey. A couple questions/worries,"Hi there, I've recently started taking steps to begin the process of having Gastric Bypass surgery. I'm planning on meeting with the surgeon I've picked out within the next couple weeks, but I have a couple questions/worries I'd like to ask people who have already gone through the process and might have general answers for.


First off, I'm 24, 5'7"", and was 259lbs at my doctors appointment last week, which puts me just at the cusp of 40bmi. No known comorbidities at the moment. Horizon medical insurance.


I have been overweight my entire life. I've never been thin/not overweight. However, I've never tried dieting or working out before to try and lose weight on my own, as I didn't have the drive, willpower, or want to do so. 




1) Will not having tried diet/weight loss programs in the past make my insurance company reject my request for coverage? Should I fib and say I've tried something in the past?




On the surgeons website I will be using, he has a medical history questionnaire form on his website that he asks patients to fill out before their appointment. One of the sections is about weight loss programs and lists a bunch of well known ones, saying it's required for insurance approval. [Example here](https://i.imgur.com/tRKCyeK.jpg). Does this mean this an automatic denial from my insurance since I've never done any?




2) My insurance requires a 6 month weight loss program completion. Since I am on the cusp of 40 bmi, I'm afraid they will deny me if I go below that with the program they require. Is there anyone with Horizon who may have had experience with this particular issue?




These next couple may be better suited for a fitness subreddit, but I might as well ask while I'm here. I'm fully aware I will have loose skin if I manage to get approved for surgery, however I'd like to do as much as I can to reduce the amount as much as possible.




3) How long after surgery will I be able to start working out? I am planning on buying an exercise bike and taking walks around the neighborhood as soon as I am able to. I'll also be joining a gym once I am comfortable enough with my body to work out in public.




4) Will starting now to work out just my arms specifically help reduce the loose arm skin after surgery?





Sorry for the long post and rambling. I'm both excited to start this journey, but also have a lot of anxiety about not getting insurance approval. I only have until just before I turn 26 to get the surgery, because then I get kicked off my fathers insurance, and we can't afford to pay for it out of pocket. So I am on a time crunch."
Favorite type of high-protein frozen pizza?,"Iâ€™m wanting to treat myself to (2-4oz of) pizza once a week, but I still want to meet my nutritional needs.

Mid day weakness on Pre-Op liquid diet,"Hey all

I'm on day 4 of my liquid diet. Felt great this morning. Now today like yesterday I'm so weak and sluggish in the middle of the day. It's hard to even type this on my phone. Does anyone have any ideas on how to cope with this or does the weakness go away?

My One Month Post Op Story With Progress Pics.,"This is an update to [My One Week Post Op Story](https://new.reddit.com/r/wls/comments/b08ke1/my_one_week_post_op_story/)

# Weight Loss

Weight Loss has been going very well so far. One month post op I have lost 13kg's/28lbs. I also lost 5kg's/11lbs during the 2 week pre op liquid diet. I had a 1 week stall after my first week post op. I wasn't phased by this as this community has taught me that they are normal, to be expected and to use other means to measure progress. My other means was my bath towel. Even though I am so big I was lucky enough to find a really big bath towel that actually fit me. It has been awesome to see how more and more of it overlaps as I lose weight.

[My First Progress Pic](https://i.imgur.com/5g6Jb64.jpg) (NSFW)

# Low Energy

While I am happy with the weight loss, it also might be a little too much too quick. It came at a cost. The 2 week liquid diet post op was fine as it was just a continuation of what I was doing pre-op, just less amounts. Pureed food stage was where I messed up. First I was super happy as now I was able to have 3 meals a day. It is a logistical nightmare for the liquid diet as it's basically 1 meal over the entire day. Now I could drink water for most of it and schedule my 3 meals. My diet also had 3 snacks during the day. Because of my schedule I was not having those snacks at all. I also wasn't following the pureed diet 100%, was eating less. The cost was a couple days after pureed started I was feeling drained, always sleepy. I am lucky that I work for a great company and my boss and peers have been super supportive. I took a lot of half days during that 2 weeks. The thing is, I just was not hungry. The food I was eating, even though it was less than my diet said, was making me full and satisfied. This has been a learning experience, thinking of Food as Fuel. Yes we want to lose weight, but we also need to look after ourselves. Stick to the diet you are give as much as possible!

# Food

As for the food side of stuff itself, I was super excited to enter the pureed phase. The first day I messed up and I fast learned what the definition of pureed meant. I was going home from the dietitian and grabbed some grilled chicken from a take away. I asked my dietitian first :) . I took some low fat mayo and my chicken and blitzed it to hell. It tasted fantastic! Except it wasn't really pureed, more shredded chicken. As I was eating it was difficult to swallow and made my stomach very uncomfortable. Pureed meant, thick but runny! She used Chicken ala King as an example of what is good to make. So I made pot of that, through it all in the blender and blitzed that. This gave me quite a few meals, unfortunately, as it was just ok. Once something is pureed, it just doesn't taste the same. Another thing she suggested was to get some small premade meals.This was a better option as if I didn't like it, I didn't have 3 full days of meals pre prepped. The best one I found was braised beef with vegetables. This I could still taste the beef and vegetables separately. After that first week I done my first ""cheat"". I stopped blitzing my eggs in the morning. It was surprising how much harder they were to eat at first. They also made me feel fuller faster. I got used to this pretty quick though. My second ""cheat"" came after I was having problems being ""regular"". I knew when I was going into the soft food phase I could have cereal. So I started this 5 days early. I had a high fiber bran flakes. The neat trick to make them super soft, quick, is to put them, with the milk, in the microwave for a small nuke. After the first week I got super bored with everything. Once I started the bran flakes, I started to have soup for lunch and eggs at night. The soup at work was awesome as its thick and rich. This just made my life easier. Now I am on soft food and I am sooooo happy. This was my first meal, on a plate, not a bowl and I could taste the individual flavors!!

[My First Soft Food Meal](https://i.imgur.com/DTLHHS9.jpg)

# Blood Pressure

Other than the low energy, I had another complication, my Blood Pressure. For some reason, the surgeon completely took me off my meds right after the op. I can understand maybe for a couple days as the meds do have blood thinners in them. This could cause some internal bleeding while I was still healing. But to completely take me off them... Well that didn't turn out so well. 3 weeks post op, besides feeling run down, I also wasn't feeling right. I went and had my blood pressure taken by our medic at work and it didn't look good. Not hospital bad, but pretty high. After phoning my surgeon to get the ok to take my meds again, I went to my GP the next day. He confirmed my high blood pressure (131/113) and was highly annoyed and angry at my surgeon taking me off the meds. He said it was not their domain or right to do so. So I went back on the meds on the Friday. Wednesday comes around and now I am feeling all light headed, even feeling dizzy while I was sitting down at work. I went home half day and took Thursday off. This was also when I started my soft food stage and was also told to add my snacks in. So I was feeling a little better. Friday I went back to the GP, my BP was 100/70. That is really low for someone my size and I was feeling a ton better that I did on Wednesday. So I can only imagine what it was then. The meds I had where prescribed when I was a lot heavier. So he adjusted the dosage and now I am on new meds. I now just need to monitor it as he will probably need to reduce that dosage again before I do completely go off them.\`

# HealingÂ 

Healing has been going well. Every day has been better than the last. Though I do wonder as some people say that they feel 100% after 2 weeks. I have been lucky enough to not have any actual hard pains after the op. However I do still feel stuff. Stuff that just doesn't feel right. Sometimes it's while im eating. Sometimes it is out of no where. A lot of the time it's when I'm walking for a long time, for exercise. I can feel my huge stomach pulling down. It feels like a strain on however the structure is in my new stomach. But I haven't been too concernedÂ  as different people heal differently. As long as I am not going backwards, I figure it should be ok. I have a 3 month catch up with the surgeon in 2 months, if it is still happening then, I will bring it up. My knees have been the big winner here. They are feeling so much better.

# Exercise

Exercise hasn't being going so good. I have been trying to get my steps in, but with the complications with my blood pressure, I haven't for the past week or two. At work I have a little rout around the office that if I do that every hour then I normally make my steps. I think this also might be one of the reasons my healing, while going well, hasn't been fast. Hopefully next week, once my blood pressure has stabilized, I should be back on track. I should also be hitting the gym soon, which I am super psyched about. I have always been fat, but I have also always tried to lose weight. Normally once a year or so, I get the energy and courage to go to the gym for a couple weeks and diet. Always to go back to my old ways though. Last year and the start of this one, was the first time I haven't gone to the gym at all. I can feel that I have lost a lot of muscle mass. I need to get back into gym and get some weights going to build my muscle back up. That and to strengthen my back. I have had chronic back pain for almost a decade now and its getting worse cause I haven't been exercising it. It is however manifesting at different times now. It used to be during sleep, I would wake up with my back all out of wack. Now it's when I do my walkingÂ  exercise, which is bad as it is affecting my work. But I know once I strengthen it up, it should help with the pain a lot. Hopefully to one day get off my pain meds.

# Sleep

Sleep has been getting better and better. As the healing has been coming along nicely I have been able to sleep more on my side for longer before it feels uncomfortable. I have also been getting more sleep than I used to before, with less interruptions during the night. Except to go to the bathroom. Sooo much water.

# Regrets

In my last update I wrote about feeling regrets getting the operation done. Pretty much feeling miserable and like a failure. Well I can say those have completely gone. As time has gone by, besides the complications, I am just feeling better all the time. While it is still a long road to travel, I am starting to enjoy the journey and can picture my destination. That is also in no small part to the people of this community. Your posts and update have kept me optimistic and hopeful.

# The End

I look forward to doing My Six Month Post Op Story. Again, this has been super therapeutic. Just writing this stuff down and putting it out there. I encourage everyone to think about doing this. No matter what stage you are in the process."

RNY Scheduled...,"I have my surgery pencilled in for October 22nd after meeting with the nutritionist. 

My one biggest problem is that my dad (who Iâ€™m really close with) is vehemently against the surgery and itâ€™s causing a rift and is probably 90% of my angst about the whole thing. 

Has anyone dealt with anything similar and can give me some advice on dealing with it?"
An end to excessive sweating?,"Did anyone suffer from crazy excessive sweating at their highest weight? I sweat like nobodyâ€™s business, especially on my head. It takes no time for me to look like Iâ€™ve run a marathon with my hair drenched. 
If you dealt with a similar situation pre-op, did/has it resolved as you have lost weight? Iâ€™ve tried special products and even medication to reduce sweating and nothing has made a difference. The sweating isnâ€™t the primary reason I am having surgery, of course, but my everyday life would be tremendously improved if it got better!"
"Post-op iron pills (warning, BM habits discussed)","So, I'm supposed to take at least 60mg of iron a day but even with stool softeners and laxatives, my stomach just can't handle that much.

Surgery day! Going in for my sleeve soon. See you guys on the losers bench!,
UPDATE: My husband had surgery and his hospital experience was horrendous,"I'm referring to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wls/comments/a3i0oo/my_husband_had_surgery_a_few_hours_ago_and_its) I made a few weeks ago.  

After we got home from my husband's surgery I was so tired and overwhelmed I never ended up calling the hospital to complain. But lucky me, he got a press-ganey in the mail and he let me fill it out. I was not nice. I mailed it in and opted to put his name and phone number, but we never heard anything back so I just moved on with my life.  

Yesterday I had surgery. Same surgeon, same hospital. Apparently while I was in the operating room, the nurse supervisor from the PACU found my husband in the waiting room and pulled him aside. They just got the survey a few days ago and knew I was about to be there. She seemed totally appalled by the way my husband was treated in PACU and apologized profusely. She even went so far to say that there was no way they would let that nurse take care of me post op, and in fact she's been moved from PACU. They said, ""she clearly was not cut out for it"". This really really makes me wonder if someone else complained because that seems extreme for one complaint, but I dont know.  

So basically after that I got some kind of VIP treatment. They had the charge nurse take care of me in PACU and they updated my husband constantly and let him sit with me about an hour after surgery. They also made absolutely, totally sure I was top priority for a room. They started preparing it ASAP and I was only in PACU for about two hours (as opposed to the seven hours he was there). 

This may seem like overkill but there are a few things I didnt mention in my post. One of my biggest grievances was that while I was sitting there, my husband started dozing off and having apneas. I seriously heard the nurse just yell, ""breathe!"" at him. I asked if he was falling asleep and he said yes, and I was like dude he's having apneas, get his fucking machine out. Why the fuck did they demand we bring it to the hospital and into the PACU where it was sitting untouched as he's having apneas? Then she goes, ""I have no idea how to set this up"". Wut. Do you not get patients in PACU every day that have machines?   

So yeah, anyway, it seems they went above and beyond to fix their mistake. And it's great that I didnt have to suffer for 7 hours in PACU being ignored like my husband, but I still feel awful for him.   

Thanks for all the advice from everyone here, it helped me confirm that this was not normal and do something about it. Hopefully now that that nurse has been moved, there won't be more incidents like this in the future."

hormones/mood swings/depression pre and post-op,"I am (hopefully) getting surgery in a month or so, still waiting on insurance, but I was wondering if anyone has seen their mental health change.

Right now I am doing really good mentally, I'm on a low dose anti-depressant and generally in the best mental health of my life. I still however have some pretty terrible mood swings (especially when Aunt Irma is visiting) and I was wondering, since estrogen is stored in your fat cells, when you reduce them does that help with reducing the hormones related to depression?"

1 month post-op - couch to 5k?,"TLDR: Any advice for a struggling post-op couch to 5k runner?

Hello folks, I am a longtime lurker here, but I had my vsg on May 14th and I sincerely thank you all for posting your stories and advice, as it helped me on my way.

After recovering, I asked about trying to start a c25k program with the intent of building stamina, and I was cleared to do so. I started on the 2nd of June, and have been attempting runs 2-3 times a week (ideally 3). At first I had some incision pain that made me slower and have to walk some splits, but the incision pain is gone now...

Unfortunately I can only finish a single split per session... One 60 second run, and then I can't finish any others in the whole session (I end up having to stop running and walk part of it). I'm still repeating week 1 rather than progressing, because I can't consistently run 8 60 second runs.

I'm wondering, has anyone else here tried a couch to 5k post op? Do you have any advice or dietary suggestions for being moderately successful? I currently try to have a fruit and yogurt smoothie for a meal on a running day, and sometimes also have a half GU, both for carbs. I also still eat about 600kcal a day. I seem to do ""better"" if I add some carbs like this, but not to a large degree.

Thank you for any advice, I appreciate it!"
Just had my pre-op call and it's finally setting in.,"I've been lurking here for a while, and have started to write my story numerous times, but would never finish or submit it because I wondered who the heck would care.  And maybe no one does, but after everything I've read here, writing it out seems to be both a means of catharsis and a hope that someone else can relate.

&amp;nbsp;

The day I went to my WLS info session I weighed 234lbs (5'6"").  I've been overweight since grade school and always felt I was ""the fat one"" in any group, and of course looking back, I'd gladly take the 175lbs high school kid who was overweight but not yet obese.  For a time I was training for a marathon and felt great, only to be sidelined with stress fractures that would never heal.  A few years later I had a skiing accident that set me back even further.  And I've done it all: obsessive exercise, calorie counting, carb counting, eating disorders, Contrave, hypnosis, you name it.  But the weight loss never seemed to last long; there was always a steady trend of losing 10lbs here and there only to gain 20lbs as soon as I stopped whatever crash diet I was on at the time.

&amp;nbsp;

I went to the doctor to get some test results and was unexpectedly diagnosed with NAFLD.  It was my birthday and not exactly the best present I've ever received.  But as a result, I finally had the courage to discuss WLS with my PCP - she agreed that it seemed like a good option to pursue, given my history.  I went to my surgeon's WLS info session the next day and was nervous I'd be rejected, despite meeting my insurance company's criteria, so I decided I would lose weight no matter what.  I started a low carb diet and by the time I had my first surgeon consult, I was down to 221lbs and very nearly missed the BMI cutoff.  To my surprise, my surgeon said she thought I was a perfect candidate and mentioned that her patients in their 40s and 50s all say they wish they'd done this 10 years ago.  [Edit: I'm in my 30s]

&amp;nbsp;

I now realize I'm lucky that things have gone so smoothly since then and I've taken it as a sign to keep forging ahead.  It'll be only 62 days from my first surgeon consult to surgery day.  I'm scheduled for next Wednesday 5/1!  I'm down to 209lbs and trying to stay on track as much as possible in these last few days.  I don't even care to have any of those ""food mourning meals"" because I am trying to do everything I can to be successful.  I figure I've had enough cupcakes and steaks and lasagna to last me a lifetime, and that ""last one"" won't taste any better than the hundreds before it.  But the best part is that I know I can still eat all of those things in the future, it'll just be in a way I've always known I need to eat but never seem to:  moderation.

&amp;nbsp;

I've spent A LOT of time on this sub, reading every post and coming back about 10 times a day to see if there's anything new.  I have learned so much from this community and very much appreciate the unfiltered, honest opinions that can be found in nearly every post.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm excited and nervous about the changes ahead, and I can't wait to finally be on the other side.  Thank you to everyone who contributes here - it helps more than you know!"
Biking while still over the bikeâ€™s recommended weight limit?,"I just had my first consultation for the VSG on Monday and Iâ€™d really like to start biking and exercising now, while the weather is nice, even before a surgery is scheduled, but I donâ€™t want to shell out for a very expensive bike to hold my current weight (283lbs). If I bought a cheap bike thatâ€™s marked for 250lbs, like this one, would that be okay in the short term? Even if I only ride it for one summer and then maybe upgrade in the future. Does anyone have any first hand experience with biking pre-surgery? Iâ€™m looking at one like this:

Surgeons in Sydney Australia,"Hi all,

New to WLS and looking for some online support.

Would anyone have any recommendations for great bariatric surgeons in Sydney Australia? Or know if there's a recommendation list or something?

I'm about to take my first steps in this journey, and I'm so inspired by everyone's progress.

Thanks in advance!"
Do you guys follow any particular diet plan 1+ year out?,"Or do you just do like protein first, then veggies, then other foods but stay away from processed foods and sugar? What do you do to stay healthy and stop yourself from gaining?"
May 13th at LIMARP in Tijuana,"Less than a month to go before I have my mini-gastric bypass with Dr. Pompa at LIMARP in Tijuana. I'm shitting bricks. I'm pretty confident in the doctor and facility. Just scared of a different life ahead. 

This is normal right?"
Want surgery but have no idea where to start...,"I am class III obese. I do also suffer Hashimotoâ€™s and social anxiety. My anxiety is not weight related, but it does prevent me from really figuring out where to go and who to talk to about getting surgery. My insurance covers the procedures for someone class III like me. I just..I do not know where to start."
Weird Sensation in my Legs,"Ever since I returned home from surgery , I have been getting this mildly uncomfortable tingling/ burning sensation in my outer thighs when I try to fall asleep . Normally, I would ignore it , but today , I woke up in sharp pain that lasted for few seconds. Did anyone experience anything like that ? * I donâ€™t think itâ€™s blood clotting because I have taken 14 shots of Clexane * . I am visiting my doctor in about a week or so ."
Scared of Food,"Hi everyone!

I had gastric sleeve surgery 5 weeks ago today. Iâ€™m struggling with what I should be eating, things to try, how much I should be eating, etc. I donâ€™t want to eat the wrong thing and screw up my weight loss. Although my nutritionist gave me some generic guidelines (which are boring as hell) I really feel like I donâ€™t have much direction which is causing me to stick to cream of chicken soup, protein shakes and ice pops.

Did anyone else deal with this? What did you eat when you were 5 weeks out?"
When did your acid reflux start post op?,"Iâ€™m 5 months post op and one of my greatest fear with the VSG has come true.  I think I have GERD.  I am constantly burping and it burns a little in the back.  I use to think it was from the constant burping, but it after researching GERD creates burping.  Gas-x stops the burping but not the slight burn."
Doing RNY while keeping a tiny human alive,"Hey all! 

I have started down this road, just waiting on my next drs appt for her to make the referral. If i am going with the timelines that I've seen in my region, I'm looking at having a 1.5-2 year old in the thick of it when i hit the surgery/recovery. Has anyone done this with a small child in tow? Seeing her grow up is one of my reasons for doing it.  how much extra help should i be looking for, any tips and tricks?"
Pre-op diet starts tomorrow. Super nervous.,"I knew this was coming for six months, but now that the time has arrived, Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll fail. After surgery I know Iâ€™ll have little desire to eat, but Iâ€™m nervous about my cravings for the next two weeks. Itâ€™s a mostly liquid diet, with one very small â€œrealâ€ meal per day. Iâ€™ve been making reasonably good food choices for the last few months, but I havenâ€™t been perfect. But now that I know I have to be perfect for next two weeks, itâ€™s giving me anxiety. Would love to hear other peopleâ€™s experiences making it through the pre op diet."
More Non Scale Victories!!!,"This past Saturday, I went to Great America and was able to fit on every single one of the rides!! Last time I went was 5 years and 90 pounds ago and I wasn't able to fit on any of the rollercoasters. I was so nervous with each ride thinking, ""this will be the one where I dont fit,"" but no! I was able to ride all of them with no problem. It's so great to see your hard work pay off in areas other than the scale. What are some of your non scale victories lately?"
RnY: still hunger pangs due to ghrelin production?,"If the stomach is left in place, wouldn't this be a thing?

3 days Post-Op (Gastric Sleeve),"415 lbs at consultation. 390 day of surgery. 385 currently.
Did anyone else have a lot of pain? Like Iâ€™m trying to drink as much water as possible, but it hurts to drink. Iâ€™m doing the baby sips recommendation. And, I have no desire to eat at all. I have a medicine ball, around my neck feeding medicine into my stomach that they say Iâ€™m allowed to take out Sunday (tomorrow) but my stomach is â€œleaking fluidâ€ and I donâ€™t know if this is bad or what. I got a follow up appointment on May 5th with my surgeon. 

Is the stomach pain gonna go away?
Do I always have to do the baby sips when drinking?
Will I get my appetite back?

I have so many questions, trying to read as much as possible on others experiences."
Question about a few things I really like,"I am in the full liquid stage currently. Once I move on to other stages, do you think I will be able to eat dried seaweed snacks, kimchi, and other pickled (fermented) veggies? I asked my dietitian and just told me she thinks those foods are weird..."
Sensory eating?,"Hello friends! Iâ€™m pre-op and still waiting on my intake appointment. I have a little more than a week left. While Iâ€™ve been waiting though, Iâ€™ve been trying to do as much work on myself as I can. Iâ€™ve completely eliminated my beloved Diet Coke and all caffeine, and Iâ€™m trying to transition to a more protein rich and lower carb diet. Iâ€™m also going through a workbook and identifying my triggers for overeating. I can sometimes be an emotional eater and Iâ€™ve come a long way with mindfulness and meal planning. Something that I havenâ€™t found much help for, though, is my tendency to overeat when I really enjoy the sensory experience of certain foods. Obviously, eliminating those trigger foods is the most effective and straightforward way of fixing this issue, but I just wondered if anyone else has the same issue, if it continues to be a problem for you, how you handle it, and any other thoughts. "
Post-op strength training clearance?,"I am 3 weeks post-op Revision from LapBand to RNY Bypass. Iâ€™ve been going to the wellness center 3 times a week to walk on the treadmill and sometimes ride the recumbent bike. I wanted to make sure I was back in the routine of going there so by the time I get cleared for strength training type machines, I would already be used to going to the gym. 
I realize that every program and doctor has their own policies but Iâ€™m just curious. How long did you have to wait to get clearance for things like strength training and weights? 
I will call my program to clarify their restrictions of course, but Iâ€™m just curious how others experienced it."
Front Close Bras?,"Iâ€™ve purchased some 3 piece pj sets (shirt, pants, and light robes) for the hospital and for home. Should I get some front close bras too? 

Iâ€™m having my sleeve a week from this Tuesday and just wanted to be as comfy as possible. 

Thoughts? How painful was dressing/undressing post-surgery?"
Alcohol post VSG,"Had dinner and drinks with my friend this weekend. Has anyone noticed that when you drink (even just one small alcoholic beverage) you donâ€™t feel as much restriction? 
I was able to eat 2 crab cakes instead of my usual 1, and felt no discomfort. 
Does the alcohol numb your tummy up or something? 
I donâ€™t want to stretch and I would like to be more mindful when in this situation. Any tips?"
When does the 6 month period end?,"So, I started going to the weight loss clinic in the beginning of January. My insurance (and the program itself) requires a six month process before getting surgery. Does this mean that you have to wait six months before even making an appointment with the surgeon? Or can you meet with the surgeon beforehand and schedule the surgery, for example, the day after the six months are up?

Iâ€™m just getting so excited about having the surgery, and want to get it done as soon as possible! I have a couple appointments next week where I can ask, but Iâ€™m just curious what everyone elseâ€™s experience was like."
Face to face Friday! 340 to 260,
Surgery is friday.,"My surgery is so close I can taste it. I've been so eager to get it. I called and bugged my insurance to push me along. Called my surgeons office enough to get them to get me in earlier. Now that it's a few days from now I am terrified. I lost 15 lbs doing a liquid diet for a few days. I wasnt getting enough calories to get thru my day of work. So when I went in for my pre op testing I was told my surgeon only has us on liquids the day before. So I started eating healthy. I snacked on celery at work and pickles when I wanted chips. I made protein oats and chia pudding. I ate chicken and veggies. Salmon and veggies. And I gained. I gained 8 lbs in a few days. I know it's most likely water weight cause I track my calories. But I still havent dropped the weight I gained when I started eating food again. I'm drinking enough water to drown a person. I drink out of quart containers at work. I fill my quart container at least 5 times. I'm getting well over a gallon of water. I take steam showers. I work a physical job on my feet and I work out when I get home 4 days a week on the eliptical. I'm only eating around 1000 calories. I dont know what else to do to get this weight down. I'm scared that my surgery is going to get cancelled because I gained since my pre op testing. 

Does anyone have any ideas of how to drop this water weight. You think I should go back to liquids? It's so busy at work until I go on leave. I'm not sure i can handle liquids only until then. "
Those surgery jitters...,"Hey guys! I am super thankful for this sub, this is my second time posting though I normally lurk. I wanted to share that my surgery date is tomorrow!! Very excited, but have anxiety over stuff that actually doesnt have much to do with the actual surgery itself. Like worrying over trivial things like packing enough undies, wondering if something weird might alert them to not do the surgery (like seeing my HS or psoriasis which they know about) , what if I say weird stuff when I wake up?

 Did/does anyone else have these dumb worries concerning the actual surgeries?

EDIT: surgery went a o-k ! Thanks for the well wishes and making me feel less alone : )"
Help me choose the right path.,"Hello everyone, im currently M/5â€™11/400 and am considering getting surgery this summer. I dont have a problem with the surgery itself, i trust modern medicine even though i probably shouldnâ€™t, im more concerned with the quality of life after surgery. I love food, love it. With that being said im ok with being restricted to a strick diet after my surgery but i will need to eat the foods that i love eventually, of course at smaller portions. Is this achievable with wls? Does anyone have any advice?"
Self image,"Iâ€™ve just been feeling kinda â€œblahâ€ about myself lately. Disclaimer: Iâ€™m not intending for the things Iâ€™m about to say to be offensive to people who are larger, itâ€™s how I feel about *myself*. I would never, ever think this about other people! 

I still feel like I am physically huge and feel disgusting and ugly. I cannot wrap my head around the way my body has changed. I took pictures today of myself in a dressing room because I have no progress pictures of myself. I donâ€™t have any preop/highest weight pictures either because I was filled with such self loathing I couldnâ€™t stand to look at myself. 

If I were to crop off my head in the photo I would think â€œwow, that persons doing a good job, they look nice!â€ But knowing itâ€™s me I canâ€™t stand to look at it... canâ€™t stand how my belly/neck/face/boobs/arms look and I just want to hide my body under layers of clothes.

I have 20-25 lbs to go and I canâ€™t imagine a magic switch flipping in my head just because Iâ€™m â€œat goal.â€ 

I just donâ€™t know if this is a normal-ish adjustment to drastic body changes? I mean, itâ€™s been a huge change in a short amount of time and it will just take time to adjust, right? Or is everyone else but me just running around with new found confidence lol?"
Thank you! You're my heroes...,"First time posting so let me start by THANKING EVERYONE who was brave enough to have WLS and share on this site. It's been instrumental in my preop journey and I can see that it will be in my postop one, as well.  You are ALL my heros. That said, I'm still very nervous as I am 8 days out from RnY...yes Valentines Day. I'm a nurse, know what can go terribly wrong, even know of a person who died and someone who developed an ischemic bowel from blood supply not being properly reconnected (required reversal), but to be fair have seen and read about far more successes.  How did you all manage the anxiety (compliantly)?"

Week 5,"Hi yâ€™all!

So this past week Iâ€™ve puked maybe 10 times. Have I done damage to my pouch? Iâ€™m freaking out!

Also, I was eating fine and this happened randomly after I had some melon. Has anybody had this!"
Things that people don't tell you about losing 100 pounds!,
Pinching feeling near left ribcage,I am 5 days post-op bypass.  I have been feeling really good other than a pinching feeling near my left ribcage.  Almost like  muscle is getting caught between ribs.  Was curious if anyone else has experienced this?
Acid Reflux?,"So Iâ€™m about three years out, and not the most strict WLS patient (I drink seltzer water, sugar in moderation, basically anything I want just a small portion) and for the last few months I have been having episodes of what I think is acid reflux. 

Iâ€™m sound asleep and all the sudden my throat is filled with burning bile. Itâ€™s so uncomfortable and unsettling. 

I guess my question is: does this happen to anyone else? Iâ€™m scheduling an appointment with a new surgeon because Iâ€™ve moved across the country but still looking for advice or...something "
My Referral Was Approved!!!!,"OMG Ya'll!!!! My referral was approved for the bariatric surgery program here in Portland! I am SO excited and nervous! I had called on Wednesday to see if they'd gotten the referral yet but they hand't gotten it into the system so they told me to call next Wednesday. I can hardly wait. I legit want to t call again and be like ""yeah so I got the referral letter!.""

First step is to schedule the ""Welcome group."" appointment I guess.

Is there anyone here from Portland who went through their surgery at the program at Legacy?"
Post Surgery Travel Restrictions?,"How long do you have to wait to travel after surgery? I am supposed to have surgery in March (exact date to be determined). I need to fly across the country 4/28.

I have a call out to my doctorâ€™s office, but they are slow in responding about this. I have found the perfect AirBnb and want to book it before itâ€™s gone."
Concerns about nicotine testing,"My program requires I pass a nicotine test before they submit the insurance request. Iâ€™m going to have my blood drawn and tested today. Iâ€™m not a smoker, but if just occurred to me that I smoked half a marijuana blunt rolled in a tobacco leaf on Friday. The program knows I use marijuana and are not requiring me to stop, but to just cut down, which I have. I really only smoke once or twice a week. I feel like an idiot for not realizing I was smoking a TOBACCO leaf that obviously contains nicotine ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½â€â™€ï¸ am I most likely going to fail this test? Or are they just looking for high nicotine levels that a regular smoker would have?"
Cold Medicine,Is there anything we can take? Tylenol Cold maybe?

18 months since info seminar - surgery scheduled!,"It's been a long wait,  but I'm scheduled to be sleeved on 7/31.   

 CoVa Care (Virginia state employee health insurance) required 12 months of call ins plus their initial consultation call - for a total of 13 months.  That ended in April and then 3 and a bit more months of wait until the earliest available surgery  date. My surgeon congratulated me on making it through my manditory insurance program.  Apparently, less than 40% complete the 13 months.   

I'm super excited and thankful for everyone's posts I've read on here over the past year!"
"50 pounds down today, almost three months out from surgery!! A year ago vs today!",
Celebrating a birthday post op,I will be one month post op (vsg)at the time of my birthday. These past few years I've celebrated with food and drinks (alcoholic) and always have a great time. I'm scared this year I'll be upset because I can't celebrate like I want to. Anyone have any ideas or ways to get around this? I don't want to risk my health but I want to do things I enjoy.
Need advice!,"Hey guys I'm new to this sub, and just now considering wls. I'm leaning towards a lap band, but mainly I'm scared about the stigma people seem to have surrounding it, I'm worried that I won't ever be able to enjoy like dinners out or special occasions anymore, and I really don't know if I would be able to afford it at all.

For background, in Australia, late 20s female, bmi 34 currently. Been trying to lose weight since I was 14 :( I succeed, and then it comes back on, and I am so over doing this time and time again and I just want to have a life where I'm not obsessing over my weight and food. Got some significant risk for health problems too.

Thanks in advance for the advice!"
Almost a week post-op and everything tastes like hell,"Had a two week liquid pre-op, and still have a few more days before my post-op appointment, but EVERYTHING tastes like medicine. Ive been doing Premier protein and the flavor in it is so thin and medicinal, that it seems to linger into everything else. Sugar free powerade is just as bad, and even my kool-aid drops in water aren't helping. 

I know tastebud changes were going to happen, but the only thing that's any good now is cherry/orange popsicles. I've tried straining soups that I loved previously and they carry that same flavor. 

Any advice on how to make it through the next few days?"
Starting at Step 1!,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been lurking for a few weeks/maybe a month now - my husband and I are both going to attend an information session about bariatric surgery. We both want to commit to doing this, as we both have a LOT of weight to lose. The info session says it is 2 hours long, which sounds a little like we might get innundated with information - any ideas on what we might expect?

&amp;#x200B;

Looking forward to sharing this journey with all of you. The posts that I've read so far have been immensely helpful."
"I want a new tattoo, but thereâ€™s less than 2 months until my surgery!","Hey everyone! Iâ€™m 19 years old and getting my bariatric sleeve surgery on July 8. However, Iâ€™ve been CRAVING more tattoos lately but am nervous of them changing after the weight loss. The goal is to lose over 100-150lbs. Should I wait until after the surgery, or do it now? Itâ€™s mainly because I want to cover up a tattoo I have on my wrist, and I would get flowers wrapping up. Any advice? Thanks!"
Hairstyles,"Iâ€™m going to change my hair to hide my hairloss and I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions? Iâ€™m thinking maybe blonde and short, but Iâ€™m not sure exactly what style I can do with such thin hair. Ideas?"
"Just a reminder, your life doesn't revolve around the scale.","Through previous experience with my lap-band I know just how easily the scale can drive you crazy. This time around I have been able to keep my weigh-ins to once a week and have been much happier. 

This morning I got a little frustrated that I've seen the same number for three weeks. Later while out shopping I decided to grab a couple pairs gym shorts to replace the 3x-4x ones that were getting pretty baggy. I took home some 1x shorts and later  realized I should have tried them on in the store because large would have been fine. Guy's I'm 46 years old and I don't believe I've been in anything that didn't have at least one ""X"" behind it since I was 12. What a great day this turned out to be."
Skin removal?,"Hey all!! Hope all is well! 

My question is on skin removal and if many have had it? 

I had VSG 4/17. Iâ€™m now down 160 pounds, and feel great, however I have a crazy amount of extra skin. I hired a personal trainer and am in the best shape of my life, but NEED this extra skin taken care of. 

When I had my VSG I had great insurance, I will now be paying for this myself, but I definitely want to get it done! 

For what itâ€™s worth Iâ€™m 5â€™7 30 years old and currently 199 pounds starting at 360 pounds."

Voltaren gel safe after gastric bypass?,So Itâ€™s only a few days since my surgery but Iâ€™m suffering from chronic muscle pain that gives me headaches. I always used Ibuprofen for them which I know is banned after gastric bypass but what about Voltaren gel/cream that you rub on your skin?

"I have an appointment with a bariatric surgeon coming up. I don't know if I'm a candidate. I really want nutritional and fitness guidance, because even though I've lost 50-100 lbs five times in my life, the last few years I feel like I don't know how to lose weight. More details &amp; question in post.","My main concern is that the surgery aims to get patients to eat smaller meals. I know I might have fatlogic goggles on, but it's my understanding that I eat small portions. I think it's likely that my wine consumption is the real issue, and I'm meeting with both this bariatric surgeon and, soon, a general nutritionist. If they tell me to cut alcohol out entirely, that will suck, but I don't think I need AA to do that because I've been specifically told repeatedly by recovering alcoholics (who work the steps *hard*) that I'm not an alcoholic. But so, most of my calories come from wine, and most days I do OMAD (one meal a day) and have for most of my life because fasting during the day is normal in my family. My mom concurs with my description of daytime eating: the second I eat anything, I become totally unproductive. The feeling of food in my stomach makes me feel slow and lethargic and truly lazy. There are definitely some days and also some phases where I really want to eat during the day, and on those days I don't drink. I think food and alcohol play similar roles, in that they both achieve a ""different"" feeling from my baseline. But so, when I do eat, at the end of the day (anywhere from 7pm to 1am) I'll make, for example, a sandwich -- not a healthy one by any means... right now I'm on a kick of king's Hawaiian sliced bread, a medium amount of light mayo, no sodium utz potato chips (yes, on the sandwich), low sodium turkey (maybe about 3oz) and iceberg lettuce, and I eat that with about half or a full bag of baked lays chips, over the course of several hours, then before bed I'll have a creamsicle or two huge oranges. There are also times I go to bed having eaten no solid food whatsoever, and this coincides with heavier, more drawn out drinking. There are also times in recent memory where my fasting went for two full days, and I didn't eat until the end of the third day. I take vyvanse so the two days of fasting coincides with taking a vyvanse pill after not having had access to it for a few days. Then there are days where I haven't gotten food from the grocery store (depression + weird personal life schedule + eating disorder marked by confusion around food...) so I'll order delivery and that might be a chinese combo of general tso's with fried rice, or a 5 piece tender box with fries, cole slaw, and 2 biscuits from popeyes, and I will *always* go to bed without finishing it, and that will be the only food for the day, and I'll eat it slowly, a few bites at a time, for several hours. To further describe the amount/pace of my eating habits: it's really hard for me to go to restaurants, because the social expectation is that you're hungry when you get there, and you order something interesting, and you leave full and happy with maybe half of the dish in a to-go box (I'm in the US, so half packed up to go is pretty standard for most people) but what ends up happening is I order something that doesn't scare me (I have a lot of fear foods but ordering from a menu at an actual establishment [not delivery] is one of the only ways I practice intuitive eating, where I really scrutinize not the menu but how I *feel* thinking about each menu option and always go with what I have the strongest reaction to) and then it comes, and I eat two, maybe three bites, and then I just sit there trying to get another bite or two in but I can't because then I will have to throw up, which is disrespectful to the people I'm eating with (even if they don't know for sure, most people know I have bulimic tendencies) and it's also just a horrorshow ethically to get food and then waste it like that.

So my big concern in going in for this appointment is that in the major way that seems to be the prescribed program, I already eat like that. My stomach only takes a few bites at a time.

Honestly I got the referral from my psych md and I don't think she knew that the clinic was just for surgery, I think she thought he was a general nutritionist. So I have the appt, but after I made it, it was explained they're not nutritionists, they're bariatric surgeons. I have another referral to a nutritionist from my GP and I want to see both of them.

I'd like for anyone who's read this far (thank you) to weigh in on whether this eating pattern (very small portions of food in a sitting) will disqualify me for surgery, so that I can think about it and make the best use of the appointment. I know a lot of people who have gotten WLS because I went to weight loss boarding school, and only a few people seem to have succeeded with it. I have one family member who got it and died because she continued eating large portions. I mean, I wonder if my predisposition to very small portions actually makes me a great candidate, or if I can expect to walk in there and basically be dismissed immediately. What do you think?

I'm 5'3"" ad 250 lbs btw, and in the last 15 years I've fluctuated between about 130 and 260 back and forth, back and forth. But four years ago I was about 175, and three years ago I was 230. I stayed 230 for like a year. I think a 55lb gain in one year is horrific, and I feel so out of control lately even though my weight isn't changing, it's just I've repeatedly instituted eating changes and made attempts to lose weight and I just am not able to stick to it like I used to. I really have kicked ass at losing weight in the past, and it's so, so different now and I don't know why and it terrifies me. Ultimately what I really want from these professionals is for them to tell me *exactly* what to eat, how much, and when. I already know that part of my eating disorder is about how I hate making decisions surrounding food so I want other people to decide, and so this will absolutely not treat the deeper issue, but what it looks like from where I'm standing is that I'm going to keep gaining weight and... lose my life. My entire life. I'm so scared."
Got my period yesterday and my VSG is scheduled for tomorrow. Will this affect surgery?,
Moving to puree too soon?,"VSG 21/8, yesterday had stitches out and told to start the puree stage the same day . Doctor recommend tuna and eggs(mashed very small) suggested as a good option for this stage too. 

I tried it and it went down, but I felt very bad after. Very heavy, bloated, some very mild pain later in the day. Today I still feel full, bloated and heavy, especially lower stomach. I donâ€™t know how I can eat 3 meals a day like I was told. My doctor says discomfort at the start is normal and my stomach will get used to it, but I donâ€™t know what is normal and what is a sign Iâ€™m not ready for this kind of food. How did it feel for you guys when you move stages?"
Didn't follow my surgeon's advice and now I'm dying. Tale of caution,"Hi. So I'm a 37 year old female who had RNY in 2016. I did great. I lost slowly for the most part, but steadily. I was NOT following my vitamin regimen like I should have because of constipation, but despite that my levels were usually good. However, about a year after surgery, I began smoking cigarettes again. A pack a day. I don't know why I started when I had quit for so long. I experienced excruciating stomach pain and eating became painful and a chore. I began losing weight at an alarming weight, but didn't call my surgeon because I was scared to tell him I started smoking. Oh I was so dumb. Fast forward to now. I ended up with pains so bad it sent me to the ER. Due to my pain level and my dangerously low weight, they admitted me so that my surgeon could see me before rounds the next morning and to monitor me. He ended up performing an endoscopy and saw many ulcers in what is left of my stomach. He made no bones about it this time: continuing smoking WILL kill me. I'm in a life or death situation. I also have an appointment with the new nutritionist, and she was so kind and so nice and is going to work with me to gain weight to get back to a healthy BMI. There is a possibility of having a GI tube inserted to help provide nutrition for a while. I think RNY was a great tool and I just didn't use it properly. My tale is a tale of caution: LISTEN TO YOUR SURGEON! They only tell you what will help you on your journey and keep you alive. Also, stay on top of your vitamins. You may not take vitamins, eat whatever you want, smoke cigarettes, or go against your surgeon's advice and you MAY get away with it. Until you don't. It took 3 years to catch up to me. I just wanted to warn others that this is a serious, life altering procedure and you must follow your doctor's advice. Don't be like me.

Edited to add that my aunt is 15 years out and never had any issues at all. But she followed her surgeon's advice. I also have many friends who had either sleeve or RNY and are doing excellent. Again, I was just pointing out how critical it is to do what your doctors tell you."
Need support getting back on track.,"27 (F). I had RNY on April 10, 2017. Within the first year I went from 275 to 173 (my lowest post-surgery). 

A little after a year out, my appetite really opened up. And so did my bad eating habits. 

Today I weigh 188, Iâ€™m ashamed to admit that I fell fast and hard from where I had previously been. I can see the changes in my body, I can see where Iâ€™ve gained and where it goes. Itâ€™s embarrassing to think that I did something as extreme as surgery and Iâ€™ve regained so quickly. I feel like Iâ€™m snowballing and the number doesnâ€™t go down. 

I only blame myself for this. I will also admit that the winter brought on my depression in full force. I hadnâ€™t felt this horrible and gutted in years. I definitely think that my depression enabled some of these bad habits as I always use to â€œeat my feelingsâ€ and is one of the contributing factors as to why I gained so much in the first place. I havenâ€™t gone to the gym, my eating habits and portions have reverted back to me pre-op habits, yet mentally I feel indifferent (for the lack of a better word). I KNOW itâ€™s a problem, I see it, Iâ€™m writing it down here for everyone to see, but I feel as though I canâ€™t get myself to a gym or to eat anything but â€œcomfort-like food.â€ 

Yesterday was the first â€œwarmâ€ (3 degrees celcius) day we had in Toronto and I got myself to take a 10 minute walk around the block before I got too cold. I saw it as a small victory, except this morning I woke up and weighed myself and I was at 188. It was crushing to see that number. Just a few days ago I had been at 186.. 

I want to get back to basics but Iâ€™ve forgotten was basics is. Today for breakfast Iâ€™m doing 1 protein drink to start the day at 9:00 AM followed by 2 soft-boiled eggs and half an avocado at 10:30 AM. 

For lunch Iâ€™ll be doing a basic chicken salad. Dinner is still up in the air. 

I feel as though Iâ€™ve lost a lot of the knowledge that was given to me. I want to get back on track. I remember what it felt to be at my lowest of 173 and I had never felt stronger or healthier. I miss that feeling but the resistance my body and mind are giving me make it feel impossible. Iâ€™m constantly saying to myself â€œIn the spring when itâ€™s warmer Iâ€™ll shed this weight againâ€ but how is that any different than when I used to buy clothes pre-op that were smaller but their purpose was â€œfor the day I lose weightâ€? Itâ€™s an excuse. I know it. 

I am hoping someone could relate. I am hoping someone could give advice on quick and healthy meals. Tips for getting back on track. 

Iâ€™m sorry if this post is all over the place, I just needed to write my struggles into existence. If anyone has any questions Iâ€™d be happy to answer and I thank you in advance for taking the time to read this and provide advice if you have it &lt;3 

Edit: I should mention I donâ€™t suffer from dumping unless I REALLY go overboard with sugar, which is why itâ€™s easy for me to consume high-fat/high-sugar foods without getting ill. I am still getting full faster than my non-RNY counterparts, usually half of their meal is sufficient for me (for reference), itâ€™s just the poor choices and lack of healthier options. "
Should I be worried?,"So Iâ€™m 16 days post vsg and yesterday I started the pureed diet. I had half an egg at dinner, thatâ€™s it. Today I woke up at 4:30am really nauseous, and now Iâ€™ve thrown up five times in the past seven hours. I really, really donâ€™t feel good and every time I drink water it triggers me to vomit again. My parents are saying this is happening because I ate too much egg yesterday. Am I really this sick because of the egg, or should I be more worried?

Thank you in advance."
Should I reconsider having surgery at a hospital that has terrible reviews?,"Hi gang, I am a two months into the at least six month long process of getting gastric sleeve surgery, and the doctor that is available is board certified and seems like a fine choice. But the hospital where he works has terrible reviews on the internet. The complaints range from really poor care, unhygienic conditions, no organization or coordination between professionals, just all around terrible. Apparently itâ€™s not safe, they needed metal detectors at all entrances and cops in the ER 24/7, which they recently removed, and a bunch of the doctors and nurses are up in arms because they do not feel safe in their workplace. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. Should I seek out a new doctor at a different hospital? Can I ask the doctor to still do my surgery but do it at a different hospital? There are lots of hospitals in my area, Iâ€™m not sure exactly which are covered by my insurance, but Iâ€™m worried about getting the surgery at this hospital. Any advice would be fantastic. Thanks!"
Combat sports after wls,"Stupid question, but after gastric sleeve by a considerable amount of time such as 6months+.
Will I be able to sign up and maybe even lightly compete in mma or boxing etc...
My question basically is if I get punched in the stomach after doing the operation by a year or 2 will I take it like everyone else, or will my stomach be too sensitive for ever .
Sorry if the paragraph is all over the place. 
Thanks in advance "
Before and during!,
Contact Lenses,"So Iâ€™m sure this is a dumb question, but the closer I get to my surgery, the more Iâ€™m thinking about everything.

They said to come without contacts and that a family member can hold on to your glasses. Iâ€™m basically blind without them and I hate the idea of waking up from surgery and I canâ€™t see. 

Since itâ€™s only a short amount of time, did any of you wear your contacts? Any issues? Iâ€™ve slept in them before without problem. 

Thanks!"
Someone please tell me it gets better...,"Iâ€™m 5 weeks out from surgery, and iâ€™m struggling so bad. About a week after surgery, I had to go back to the hospital because i was experiencing pain/nausea so bad that i couldnâ€™t get down anything, including water. I was there for about 4 days because I had high lipase levels which had something to do with my pancreas. I went home feeling a lot better, but about 2 weeks after that, I was having constant nausea and nothing was helping, so my doctor advised me to go back to the hospital. My lipase levels were even higher...but they still canâ€™t seem to figure out whatâ€™s going on, or whatâ€™s causing the high levels.

Because of the hospital visits and lipase/pancreas issue, iâ€™ve had to restart my diet over twice, and iâ€™m feeling stuck in the pureeed/liquid stage. Itâ€™s horrible. it sucks. 

I hate protein shakes/powders. Before surgery, I was able to tolerate them...never liked them but I could drink them. Now itâ€™s a different story. Iâ€™ve tried unflavored protein, protein water, all types of protein flavors and I canâ€™t stand them. I have no idea what to do.

My family is worried, but they just keep pressuring me to eat, when most of the time iâ€™m nauseous and feel like i canâ€™t. They donâ€™t understand, I donâ€™t understand. Iâ€™m regretting this surgery so much right now. I hate it. People keep telling me to stay positive but I canâ€™t. I just want to feel better...

Fellow losers strength training post surgery,"How are you folks doing? Couple questions...

Are you able to build muscle? 
Are your upping your weight?
Have you been able to stay on a regular/structured plan?
Are you using a personal trainer? If so- have you gotten results?
How much protein (and in which form) are you getting?

Thanks!"
Something I've noticed about WLS groups on FB....,"Okay, I know the clear answer is to stay off of Facebook because it can be such a cesspool lol, but I really have joined a few groups that I like. A lot of them give helpful information and I like to see other's journeys and advice. But anyway...  


I'm apart of three different wls pages. One is specifically for the place where I'm going to have my surgery, and the other two are just general pages comprised of sleevers. Something annoying I have noticed is that every time someone posts that their surgery went wrong, or they suffered some kind of side effect (bad enough to land them in the hospital) I find that the comments get vicious and very accusatory. They start pointing out how rare these side effects are and insinuate that the person having the issues didn't do something right or had issues pre-surgery that they didn't make known to their surgeon. They blame the OP and it's almost like they are mad any time someone says anything even remotely against surgery.  


Is this what all the groups are like? Do you think a lot of sleevers have this mentality? I'm just curious. I keep seeing it happen and I just wonder why."
My surgery was yesterday! VSG,"So excited to be starting my journey officially!  So far pain is under control and I walked three laps of my surgery floor.  

I truly appreciate the help and support of this r/wls - especially last week when I was complaining about being hungry on the liquid diet.  You guys ROCK!"
"Late night worries, long post","Hello everyone! 

So I just had my history and physical and got the checklist of what I need to get done to continue the steps. Iâ€™m feeling optimistic and have been diligently scheduling appointments and such. 

So I havenâ€™t been to a general doctor in years. (Always felt judged.. my pediatrician was a huge hypocritical bitch and very cold.) I got one half ass check up last year when I switched doctors, and the nurse practitioner filled out a form of my questionnaire when I had to go in for a quick visit. (My new pcp suggested I go vegan the first time I met her to help with weight loss.. not knocking veganism, but thatâ€™s kind of extreme for someone who admittedly tells you they struggle with food/eating right off the bat) 

So of course to all of the questions they asked in my history, most of my questions are no. 

My A1C text came back and Iâ€™m at a 6.3 which according to doctor google is borderline diabetes. I know my PCP will be informed but like am I fucking myself up by not like having had tests done? Iâ€™m not having symptoms of what they asked. Will this affect my surgery recovery? 

I mean things like, when they ask if I have like DVT or like chest pain? (I had an ekg in dec bc I thought I was having s heart attack turns out Iâ€™m an anxious teacher who freaked out and I am perfectly normal) to be fair, I did tell them about the chest pain I had but currently donâ€™t have any. Also dvt was an example, I think Iâ€™d know, at least, right? 

Also, when they asked about depression, Iâ€™ve never been diagnosed but donâ€™t we all feel depressed sometimes? 

I just wanna do right by myself ya know? I hope Iâ€™m not over thinking things. Or maybe I do hope that so I can chill out."
I feel like alcohol isn't really affecting me,"I'm 4 months out from sleeve surgery and have drank twice. The first time was about three weeks ago, I had a half a glass of moscato over a four hour time period because it was my first post-surgery drink and I didn't know how I would react. 

The second time was on Saturday. My friends had a party and I had two glasses of wine and a margarita over a 7ish hour time span. I was buzzed, but I was never drunk and never felt that I wasn't in control. I've always heard that even a little bit of alcohol seems to get people wasted almost immediately now so I was super vigilant of that, but it never happened. 

Prior to surgery I was a pretty big drinker. I was *really* into craft beer and bartended at several breweries, so I had a pretty high tolerance, but I haven't had a single drop of anything since Christmas because I wanted to follow the surgery requirements. I figured a 5 month hiatus would probably dampen my tolerance, but maybe not? 

Has anyone else noticed that they don't get overly affected by alcohol?"
Need Support - Scheduled for VSG on Feb 20 - STARVING on liquid diet,"Hi!  After 9 months to qualify, I am scheduled for my VSG next week. Iâ€™m 4th day into my liquid diet and Iâ€™m starving. My stomach is rumbling non-stop and Iâ€™m drinking all Iâ€™m supposed to. 

Please tell me after surgery Iâ€™m not going to be this miserably hungry!?

Any help/support appreciated. "
The best Greek yogurt!,"Hey everyone! I just discovered this Greek yogurt and thought Iâ€™d share it with people who care ï¿½ï¿½.

Itâ€™s called Two Good by light and fit. 
12g Protein,
3g Carbs (2g from sugar),
2g Fat,
80 Calories

The first time I had it I thought â€œmehâ€ because itâ€™s not as sweet. However, it has grown on me, I could eat it every meal and be happy with it. Iâ€™ve only been able to find it at Target so far, for 1.49 a cup. 

Highly recommended! The peach is the best, then vanilla. Strawberry and blueberry are ok."
Potentially free tummy tuck if you participate in this study!,
Spicing up protein shakes,My surgeon wants me on two weeks of what they call stage 2 (protein shakes). My surgery is on 23 Apr. I need to get 60-70 grams of protein with no indication of amount of calories. I am using Unjury (I have all flavors except the terrible chili one) and Fairlife milk or water. Any thoughts on how to spice things up a bit? Anything to make the chicken flavor more fulfilling?
Starting liquid diet,"Today I start just liquids. Iâ€™m only doing this for one week before surgery because Iâ€™m a type one diabetic and we were adding in extra carbs (say 1 oz of toast, or approximately 15-20 g) twice a day to keep my blood sugar and ketones under control. Iâ€™ve been doing that modified diet for about two months. But now my carbs will have to come from juice, because I also have gastroparesis and they need to make sure thereâ€™s nothing in my stomach the day of the surgery and solids have been known to stick around for days. Anyway, Iâ€™m not looking forward to this, since due to gastroparesis my stomach is rarely empty and I donâ€™t get hungry much and Iâ€™m not amused with BEING hungry when Iâ€™m getting a surgery most people get to stop being hungry. 
Also very anxious about surgery. In an attempt to soothe me my surgeon told me, and I quote, I wasnâ€™t â€œthe most complicated case theyâ€™ve ever hadâ€. I was like, I didnâ€™t know I was in the running, but thanks. And Iâ€™m self pay, so if there are complications not only is it, you know, bad, but itâ€™s coming out of my pocket!
Anyway, Iâ€™m just a ball of nerves."
No appetite,"I had surgery on Feb. 5 and I am supposed to be getting into purÃ©ed foods, but I have no appetite at all. I am just thirsty. Should I try to eat or just listen to my stomach and not feed it unless I am hungry. I was doing alright until I got extremely, painfully constipated for most of this week. That was incredibly rough! I canâ€™t tell if Iâ€™m nauseous or just not hungry. Any tips or suggestions? "
They brought donuts in to work today.,But I can remember the last time I had a donut. I can't remember the last time I could tie my shoes without a struggle. Day 7 of pre-op liquid diet continues.
Iâ€™m approved for WLS!,"Hey everyone! Iâ€™m approved for the sleeve and will likely have it at the very end of July or very early August. Iâ€™m a teacher, so Iâ€™m wondering how bad the pain and weakness really has been for those of you who have had lap surgery beforeâ€”in particular. Anyone feel free to chime in, but I had a previous lap surgery (gallbladder) and 2 weeks was more than enough to get over the pain and weakness. Iâ€™m wondering if the pain might be similar. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I did take it easy for more than 2 weeks, but Iâ€™m torn between when to have the surgery. I have a 40 min commute (80 round trip) for one of my jobs (I teach in 2 schools) and am not sure if I should try to start teaching in mid/late August or to tell my employer to expect me back the first working/teaching day after Labor Day. That would give me nearly a month to recover and adjust and if Iâ€™m able or approved to go back sooner, Iâ€™m sure I couldâ€”or at least I could ease back in to work. 

Thoughts? Iâ€™d like to have the gastric sleeve surgery. Canâ€™t believe this tool is within my reach! 

Thanks for all the support!"
My steps so far! Surgery Date set at July 23rd!," 

Good afternoon everyone! I just wanted to share my process with everything and where I am at right now!

I started my journey back in the beginning of March. I am 5 foot 5 inches and weighed 293lbs. I have completed the nutritional power-point, sleep study, psychological exam, my last nutritionist appointment, and today I met with the surgeon. I did not have to have the ultrasound of my gallbladder done, as I had it removed almost 9 years ago. I have been approved by everyone to go forward with the surgery! Surgery date is set for July 23rd!!! 

The diet portion was the hardest for me to accommodate. I am a wife and mother to three children. I had to make two separate meals each night as they did not usually like what I had to make for myself. As I am a stay at home mom, we rely on my husband income, and eating healthy is costly. I bought my items as they went on sale and ate only what the nutritionist listed on my paperwork. I had to do two months of the diet change. Just two! The first month she had me add more veggies and to make sure my yogurt and salad dressing was light. I let her know that its easier for me to do canned veggies but the sodium was higher than what she recommended. She said to buy them, but just rinse them off with water before eating. That really opened up my veggie choices and made it easier to meet my 3 cups of veggies a day goal. By simply changing my diet, I have lost 27 pounds!

The next portion for me was the psych exam. It was really simple and not at all what I had expected. The doctor asked me questions about my childhood and current adult life. He had no issues approving me, but he did share his own thoughts and feelings. He said to me ""A percentage of people who have this surgery done fail. You are young and this is a lifestyle change. There are other means for you to lose weight. The hospital knows how I feel about this as I have shared my thoughts with them many times. With that being said, I have no issues approving you for the surgery and I will get my report sent over."" 

The sleep study was what I was most worried about, as my husband tells me that I snore quite often. The sleep doctor informed me that my mouth anatomy is 'abnormal' but its not something that anyone can fix as this is just how my mouth is. I also had ridges along my tongue from it vibrating in my mouth due to the snoring. The doctor also said that if the tests come back with positive results of sleep apnea, I will have to wear a cpap machine for 3-4 months and actually use it before he can approve me. After my appointment with the sleep doctor, I had to wait a week for my insurance to approve the study. My insurance only covers a home sleep study which the doctor said would be enough. I picked up the machine about two weeks later and proceeded to do the home sleep study. It was awful! I was wrapped up in wires, had tubes in my nose, and my finger got too hot from the O2 meter. It also forced me to sleep on my back as if I tried to sleep on me sides or tummy, a tube would get kinked and cause the machine to show red lights. A few days later I received a call from the sleep doctor. He asked me if I slept alright or if I had issues. I told him it was unconformable, but I did sleep. He then asked me if I had slept for more than 4 hours. I had, as I turned the machine on at 10pm and off at 7am. In the end, the results showed that I did not have sleep apnea and that he had no issues approving me for surgery.

The whole process has been tiring but well worth it.  I will be the third person in my family to get weight loss surgery done. My mom had the bypass almost 5 years ago and looks great! My aunt had the band put in roughly the same time as my mom, and unfortunately, she has only gotten larger. I am hoping that with my husbands and moms support, I will also be a success story! Thanks for taking the time to read my story and if you have any questions or thoughts, please let me know! â™¥"
July 2018 vs July 2019,
Anyone have WLS in Illinois?,Hi friends! This is my first post here. I'm 31F and considering WLS. I feel like I've been dieting my whole life and I feel like WLS is a good option for me. (CW 290). I was wondering if anyone had WLS in Illinois and what surgeon you used. I live in the NW suburbs of Chicago. Any information is welcome. (This sub is so awesome and informative!)
"these photos were taken one year and one hundred pounds later. (307 -&gt; 204, VSG 12/10/18)",
This surgery saved my life! So excited to see what 2019 brings.,
"Had my gastric bypass in april 2017, maintaining since may 2018 - I'm so grateful for this new chance at life!",
Got my surgery date,"I got the call yesterday and I have my pre-op visit July 1st and surgery July 2nd. It's getting so real. 

Did you guys have any finally meals or anything before you started the liquid diet? Like a farewell party haha."
Still stalled...,"I've always had trouble losing weight. Diets where people were just losing weight left and right did nothing for me. So I was hoping with the surgery that would change. But now I'm feeling like I'm even failing at that. I had my surgery two months ago, and while I lost about 20lbs the first few weeks, I've completely stalled. 

At this point I've lost zero pounds for about a month and a half. I've heard that's not unusual and that normally you lose inches instead of pounds. But none of my clothes are fitting any looser either. I know there's that post-op stall that everyone talks about but I see people who are a few months out and just shedding the pounds. It's really discouraging and I don't know if I'm doing something wrong or what. I'm barely eating anything cause I can't eat more than like, three or four bites of protein without getting full and any sort of bread or starch makes me sick. I'd say I'm still taking in only 500-600 calories a day. I'm not like, super hungry either so I can't understand how I can be taking in so few calories but losing nothing. 

I know basically the answer is just to wait it out, it'll get better, but my brain is working against me lol It's telling me it won't, that I'll be one of those people who had the surgery and are still overweight. Is there anything that can be done besides just waiting to get things moving again?"
A little apprehensive,"So I'm big. Like 360lbs on a 5'6 body frame and most of my fat is on my stomach. I'm 30 a female and I have a lot of health issues that all lead back to morbid obesity. Fatty liver and pancreas...pcos....thyroid problems....high blood pressure....theres more but you get the point. 

Anyway, I got pre approved for the gastric sleeve...yay. all I needed thanks to my bmi of 58, was a nutritional and psychological evaluation. Cool. Psych is next week, nutrition was today. Awesome. Went thru everything I need to do about getting the time off work with my sweet hr lady today. Cool. Things are getting checked off my list. 

My question is...how hard is it to resist temptations once you are back at work. Are you tempted to eat the cupcakes betty brought to work for Susie's birthday? I ask because I'm a pastry chef. It's my passion and one of the loves of my life. It also made me the morbidly obese woman I am. Am I gonna wanna tear off a piece of fresh baked baguette every morning? Am I gonna constantly fight the urge to taste the ice cream as it comes out of the machine? I'm just a little worried that in order for me to be healthy that I've gotta alter my lifestyle and choose a different career where I'm not going thru a case of butter making sweets all day. 

"
Surgery in 10 days!,"Got my surgery date, starting preop stuff soon. Pretty nervous, and feeling super guilty about how selfish I'm being. Has anyone else gone through this? It's a huge cost to my husband and I, plus the time and money lost for work, plus the travel and the people who have to look after our house and pets for a whole. Feels like I'm putting everyone out for something I want."
Face gains! Left is last summer. Right is today. Sleeved 3/4/19.,
"I am thinking of getting weight loss surgery, but I have so many questions...","I've been considering weight loss surgery for a long time now, but I'm really uncertain about the restrictions it would place on me. Over the past few weeks, I've been trying to research it a bit more.

&amp;#x200B;

I was looking at [this website,](https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/dietary_guidelines_after_gastric_bypass/) and it seems like for many months after surgery, your calories are supposed to be restricted  to 300-600 calories a day. So then is it really the surgery itself then that causes you to lose weight? Or is it really the severe calorie restriction? Does the surgery make you less hungry overall? Because on all of the diets I've tried that severely restrict my calories, I've always been starving, and thats eating around 1200/day. I'm having a hard time imagining how I would fare on 300 calories a day.

&amp;#x200B;

Are you still allowed to eat carbs after weight loss surgery?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if I had it done, I wouldn't want anyone at work to know about it. With that in mind, how long is the recovery time after surgery? Is it really hard to hide that you've had weight loss surgery?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also wondering about drinking things like coffee and tea. The website said that your stomach is the size of an egg at first, but that eventually you will be able to eat 900-1000 calories in a day. I drink my coffee black. Would I be unable to drink the same amount of coffee that I currently drink (like 3-4 cups a day)? Or would I just have to drink it a lot slower?

&amp;#x200B;

Does your stomach eventually expand to a larger size again?

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, do any of you have any regrets about getting weight loss surgery?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Also, the website says long term you should eat only low-fat, low sugar foods. What happens if you eat a food with some sugar or fat in it? like what if I were to have a Christmas cookie or a small piece of birthday cake? Would it be harmful to me? 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for all of the questions, and thank you to anyone who answers!"
"People who are years and years out, are you keeping the weight off? Do you think most people do?","I'm a couple days away from surgery and for some reason I'm less nervous about surgery itself and more nervous about my long term results. I know I should be more concerned with the present but I cant seem to help it at the moment. I work in a sleep lab and have had a slew of weight loss surgery failures lately. I know it's likely confirmation bias because skinny people arent going to have sleep apnea as often and wont be in the sleep lab, but it's starting to feel like everyone who has surgery gains the weight back.  

What do you think? Do most people keep it off long term?"
What was/is your daily caloric intake 1.5 years post RNY gastric bypass?,Can't really find any information on this online so I'm trying to find some answers elsewhere. Currently 1 year and 4 months post-op and I gained 2kg the past 2 months so I'm surely consuming too many calories.
Am I ready for WLS?,"I need help deciding if I should go ahead with surgery.   Please share your unvarnished opinions. 

I am 39, married, SAHM to three kids (7F, 4F, 1M).  I will be getting my surgery date soon.  I don't know if I should go ahead with the surgery right now.  


#Con:


-My life is so crazy with the kids.  It's like being around three short drunk people all day.  I have a good routine but kidz be crazy.


-I have not had a proper sleep in eight years because of pregnancy, breastfeeding, kids in general.  No apnea or anything like that.


-I'm still breastfeeding my one year old and will probably continue right up to my surgery date.  I'd like to give my body a chance to adjust before I have surgery.


-I have not been tracking my food because I just don't feel like it.  In my mind I feel like I am keeping so many balls in the air that tracking is one thing I feel like I can let go of.


-When I plan my food ahead I don't eat according to what I planned because the day gets away from me because of the kids' needs, and the house is messy, and  taking care of myself feels like the last priority. (I have to get up at 5 am just to ensure I can get showered and dressed.  I'd have to get up at, like, 3:30 am to exercise and prepare my food for the day.)  And sometimes I just want to eat what I feel like.


-I'm haven't been exercising, because I don't know when the heck I could squeeze that into my day.


-My mom and husband think I should not get the surgery because ""if I really tried I could just lose the weight"" with diet and exercise.  Being fat is a character flaw.


-My husband will probably not be much help after the surgery because he is kind of a dink Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯ .



#Pro:


-Life is always going to be crazy.  I still have to take care of myself.


-By the time I get the surgery my youngest will be more independent, making him easier to take care of.


-Statistically, even if I am done breastfeeding I will not be successful at losing weight and maintaining the loss long-term because science.


-I really want to go hog-wild on second hand clothing because it will actually fit!


-I do not want to suffer through another hot sweaty fat summer.  Oh how I am dreading the summer (Â´;ï¸µ;`)


-I want to be active with my kids: skiing, tobogganing, playing tag, biking, 


-I will have a low enough BMI to get approved for a breast reduction, finally (Dr says my BMI has to be &lt;32).

Today is my 5 month anniversary for RNY and I'm down 65 lbs.,"I'm going hiking today and couldn't be happier with my journey so far. There are people here that have lost more, faster but I'm understanding everyone is different. I'm going in the right direction and feeling better everyday. My only regret is sticking with the lap-band as long as I did.

EDIT: I MADE IT! https://imgur.com/Hrn6kep.jpg"
Pre OP freak out,"I am 4 days from my surgery, and I'm freaking out. I think it's the general anxiety of looming surgery + this f-ing pre op diet lack of calories and carbs, but I am a mess. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal?"
Exercise,"I'm two weeks post-op. I go walking everyday and I feel like that is a completely appropriate amount of exercise at this point. I plan on getting back into the gym about 8 weeks. 

Just wondering when everyone else started at the gym and how slowly did you take it? Any schedule suggestions? What are your thoughts on a steam room?(especially with a reduced capacity for water intake)"
External Staples,"This may seem like a big baby post considering that I just had surgery a week ago, but Iâ€™m dreading the staple removal today. There are 19 total. Can anyone tell me if it hurts very much?"
Pre WLS - What would you have done differently pre-op?,"I'm booked in for a VSG in 7 weeks and really keen to hear from others wished they had done pre-op.

Taken progress shots?
Bought bluetooth scales?
Read a particular book?

I'm thinking of starting a 1 second a day video collection to track progress for myself..."
I don't want to eat,"Title says it all. A bit over two months post surgery and I just...don't feel like eating. I'm never hungry and when I do eat, I'm able to eat so little it's not even worth the effort.  That is, if the food itself doesn't make me sick. I started tracking my calories as was suggested to me and I'm averaging, on a good day, about 700 calories a day. But like yesterday? I had 2 bites of roast beef, half a cup of salad and 2 bites of chicken breast for the entire day. Right now it's noon and I've eaten nothing, nor had the desire to. When I do try to eat, just about all proteins make me sick. Red meat, pork, seafood, milk, cheese, nuts, eggs, it all makes me sick. So I am not getting anywhere near the protein I need. 

I'm still stalled as well, which is frustrating given how little I'm taking in. Which, ftr, I know isn't healthy and I'm not looking to keep things the way they are. I feel fine actually so that's a plus at least. I was thinking of getting some protein powder but does that even taste any good in water? I can barely drink my water as is, if it tastes nasty I'm going to have a really hard time. Any suggestions? Thanks guys."
Wls revision,"I see some people say they had wls revision done.  I'm curious, what causes the need for a revision?"
How long did your week 3-4 stall (first stall) last?,"Hey guys, I just finished week 4 after my RNY surgery, and I have been almost the exact same weight for two weeks. This seems so scary and frustrating.

I've been on soft foods this week, mostly eggs, cheese sticks, premier protein, refried beans, etc. Some soft chicken or fish occasionally. I did get into some sugar free pudding, but those are like 80 calories each."
Dumping,I'm surprised that there's not more talk about dumping on this sub. Maybe because it seems like more people are getting sleeves vs RNY. I'm just over 2 years out from RNY and some things still make me dump. Other times the exact same food will be fine. There's no rhyme or reason to it. I drink a Mt Dew daily (yeah I'm aware of how bad it is) and never ever dump from the sugar in it but if I buy the wrong kind of peanut butter and have a spoonful I'm sweating and heaving. Does anyone else here experience dumping. 
Medical marijuana,"I take medical marijuana for pain and nausea, and Iâ€™m wondering if anyone has experience of if that hits you differently after the surgery. My surgeon didnâ€™t mention anything about it, and I listed it in my medications, but I wasnâ€™t sure if it was like alcohol. Does it matter if itâ€™s inhaled or ingested?"
Not giving up!,"On April 30th I will be one year post op, and what a year it has been. So far I am down 90lbs from my highest weight and 80 from my start weight. I have about 30lbs left to go.

I only lost 10lbs since November because I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, and my life has been a roller coaster of medicine that promotes weight gain, mood swings, seeing/hearing things that aren't there, going catatonic, and so on. In the midst of all that my diet hasn't been great because I went back to using food as a crutch, and my medicine makes me hungry. Exercise was out because I could barely keep up on my hygeine. And now I have lost my job and no longer have insurance. 

This all started 6 months or so post op, and I didn't have symptoms at the time of my surgery or in the 6 months before when we were doing the medical clearance. 

Even with all this, I am determined not to give up and as of today recomitting myself. I decided to do my two week pre-op diet of two shakes and a small meal to kind of re-set things for me, and get back into eating cleanly and in smaller portions. I am writing this post to just throw it out into the universe that even though I had a major set back, I am in control of my food choices and I can still do this. I am not a failure, and I couldn't have predicted this would happen to me. I can lose 30 more pounds and reach my goal weight! "
Surgery office called,"So this is my first post to the group. I have been reading and watching you guys/girls kick butt. 

I had my consultation on April 26 and my first dietician appointment on April 30. I got a call this past Friday that my insurance has updated and I no longer need the 3 months of dietician visits. I will have everything else completed as of this afternoon. I can't wait to get my surgery date! 

I haven't told anyone I am doing the surgery and had to tell someone."
My turn! 9 months and 86 lbs apart.,
How many calories did you eat at 6 weeks out?,"Yesterday I was cleared for all foods by my nutritionist, however my program refuses to give calorie guidelines. My instructions are to listen to my body and ""trust the process"". This is incredibly frustrating because I never really get a full feeling until I've eaten a lot, and I'm certainly never satisfied. I just can't seem to get a grip on how much to eat and when. What were your program guidelines for this far out? I just want to make sure I'm not overdoing it. Thanks!"
Pre-op diet question,"Hi everybody!!

I got the news today that my insurance approved me!!!!!!! Ah!!! Waiting for my surgeonâ€™s office call to schedule me.

I was excited for five seconds and now Iâ€™m realizing that I have maybe 30 days left before I have to start my two week pre-op liquid diet.

My nutritionist kind of scared me. Iâ€™m told that Iâ€™m probably going to have diarrhea and then constipation during pre-op liquid diet. They sell some kind of protein shake for the pre-op phase in the office that has fiber to help alleviate those symptoms.

Iâ€™m just wondering how common those kind of issues are during pre-op? I was planning to work until day of surgery until she told me to stay by the bathroom. :( Is this something I really need to be concerned with?"
Final Pre-Op Appt Question,
"Hoping to get WLS, wondering if anyone else started out with similar stats as me?","Iâ€™m 5â€™4 and 220 pounds , 37 BMI. Iâ€™ve been overweight since I was a kid. 
I have high blood pressure, and PCOS (which I know isnâ€™t a comorbidity, but it doesnâ€™t help, lol!) I have horizon BCBS insurance and looked into the requirements for WLS which is BMI over 35 with 1 comorbidity, a 6 month supervised weight loss program, participate in a surgery preparation program, and a recommendation letter for my primary doctor. 
Iâ€™m just starting out and waiting for the surgeon to call me back next week to hopefully schedule an appointment, but I have a few questions/ concerns. 

1. Has anyone else qualified with similar stats as me? How long did the process take you from 1st appt to surgery? 
2. What if I get below a 35 BMI during the 6 month supervised diet? Could they deny me if I lose weight? 
3. I am diagnosed with anxiety and mild depression (Iâ€™ve been going to therapy for a while for it) will that deny me during the psych evaluation? 
4. My depression is induced by my weight. I read that occasionally depression or psychological stress resulting from obesity can be considered a comorbidity, has anyone had this? 
5. Iâ€™ve gone through so many weight loss efforts, at one point lost 50 pounds and got down to 170 in 2016, but gained it all back, will they deter me from getting approved since I am able to lose weight on my own? Even though I gain it back every time?

Thank you to everyone for answering in advance. "
No Vitamin E on two week preop liquid diet?,Did I read the doctors order correct that I can't consume vitamin E on the pre-op liquid diet? That concerns me because all of my premier protein shakes contain 33% daily value of Vitamin E.
Almost 4 weeks out from VSG. Am I eating too much?,"My program doesnt recommend a calorie number, just a protein minimum of 80g for males. I am easily hitting that since a few days after surgery. Now I am easily getting 100 grams of protein per day, and eating around 800 to 1000 calories per day. 

I can easily eat 2 eggs and 1/4th cup of cottage cheese for breakfast. Lunch I can easily eata cup of brocolli and and 4oz of deli meat. Dinner I eat 4oz of salmon and a cup of brussel spouts. I also usually have 1 protein shake per day.

Im not eating until I'm sick, just until I have a sense of fullness.  Is this too much?


Still actively losing weight with no issues. VSG at 381, currently 363.5. Almost 20 pounds in 25 days."
Are stomach spasms normal?,"Hi wls! I've been lurking for a while, but this is my first post.   


I am 2 weeks post-op (sleeve) and am on purees. I have been experiencing stomach spasms pretty much every time I eat, and sometimes just with liquids (shakes, soups, etc). I have also had them occur when I'm doing neither. These suckers hurt! I don't know what they mean or how to avoid them. Are they a sign something is wrong? Eating/drinking too fast/too much? I feel like I'm eating slowly and small enough bites, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. Or, are they just part of the healing process? Do they ever go away?"
Needing some support from others who've been here,"Now, at risk of sounding like a total baby, I'm struggling so hard. I'm a bit over 3 months out from surgery and I'm not sure where my mind is. I've lost 65lbs since surgery date, 11/26/18, and part of me is wondering if I'm losing too slowly. Another part of me gets very self conscious about all calories, and I count every one. It's 6:30pm and I have had 350 calories today (I have yet to eat dinner.) And I wonder if I'm eating too many calories. I guess I should have asked more about what to expect? How much weight should I be losing? How much food should I be eating? 

&amp;#x200B;

A little backstory is that for over a month after surgery, I had a major stricture where for the greater amount of that time I couldn't even consume protein shakes. It was only water and broth for almost the entire time. I was super malnourished and had no energy and was in bed all the time, life was horrible. I had an EGD 01/07/19 and managed to eat for about 3 days before I was back to square 1. I couldn't eat food anymore and was back on liquids for almost another entire month before another EGD. As of February 8th, I was able to eat again. I guess that would make sense as to why I suddenly hit a hard stall for a little over 2 weeks. I'm losing again, but I'm so worried that I'm eating too much and not losing fast enough. Maybe I'm just focusing too much on this.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I am looking for is other perspectives and maybe just a little support. This community has been great so far. Thank you."
VSG First Consultation Today,"Hi everyone, 

I've been in this forum for several months and finally had a consultation today. 


Everything was about what I expected. Some take aways I had if anyone is interested:


1) He started out asking if I was familiar with the process (yes) and what questions I had. I warned him I had a list of 30+ questions, literally a 2 page doc that I've just been adding to over the last couple months, he didn't bat an eye. Answered everything patiently, and backed up answers with some statistics and such. I was very satisfied.


2) As I suspected, my insurance ""covering"" it was a joke, I had to be with them for 12 months, then after that do weight watchers for 6 months, lose 10% of my body weight, do a psych eval, and then still have a person from their team decide if they will cover me. My doc has a chask price of $11k, with the insurance even if I do somehow do all that it's still $5k. Cash price it is.


3) I was a little surprised at how little requirements there were for cash price patients. One group session, one dietician meeting, and I already had a referral from my primary care physician. Outside of that it's a small diet and 1 day clear liquids. That's it. (More on the diet below.)


4) If he is going to be out of town he won't schedule surgery the two weeks before it, which I appreciate because I want him around if anything happens. Consequently between his schedule, mine, and my husband's, I am probably looking at the end of May. 


5) I am currently at my highest weight, he wants me to lose 10lbs before surgery. He only requires a 1 day liquid diet, but basically said if I did 2 weeks liquid that's one way to do it, or I can eat really healthy and hope to do it without 2 weeks liquid right before surgery. I have been dieting forever, but I admit, I cheat. I plan to cut down on the cheating, and maybe replace breakfast or lunch with a protein shake, and see where that gets me. I am hoping since I have about 2.5 months I can lose at least 5 (while still probably having one last goodbye to pizza and cinnabon) and then maybe do 1 week of liquid just to mentally get in gear for surgery. (I'd like to point out that yes, while I could probably someday still have pizza or a minibon, the amount I want to lose and keep off is more than average, so I need to be really strict post sleeve, and I don't know that I have the willpower for slippery slopes so I plan to abstain from these things period after surgery. Yeah, I could and probably will have a slice of a flat bread pizza or a healthier cinnamon roll someday, but people in this forum probably can understand that isn't the same greasy giant New York slice or a frosting laden cinnabon, I need to say goodbye.)


6) One of my biggest concerns was chugging water, I get at first it's a total no, but I was hoping he would say eventually yeah I could drink water however I'd like. I did not get the positive encouragement that I was hoping for on that front. I got a skeptical maybe...


7) I really liked the statistics. He has a program on his computer that logs all the patients he has had, their weights over time, any complications. He can filter it by surgery (vsg), starting bmi, age, comorbidities. It's pretty cool. It even was able to look at the subset of patients with my age/bmi/etc and perdict my odds of complications and expected wight loss over time for me specifically. None of his patients have died, he has done over 1000 vsg's, his weight loss is above average, and his complications just below average. All good.


8) I think both my husband and I felt much better and more confident in this decision after the appointment. 


9) Indirect thing, I even was brave enough to tell me parents: Dad first, because he is far more supportive, and he was, even offered to pay for it. Mom, as expected, was skeptical, said to get another opinion, that she knew 5 people who did it and all gained back the weight except one, who died. She thinks that I should just do the diet without the surgery, or maybe get some injections. She knows I have been dieting for literally years, and now wants me to try only eating 4oz at a time, I tried to explain how without a smaller stomach 4oz would not make me feel full and that I could not maintain that long term on my own, she said I would get used to it. Honestly, that's about what I expected. She said ""she wasn't saying no, but she wouldn't say yes until I had done xyz"". I reminded her it was my body and ultimately I was the one deciding. She said if she was paying for it she could say no, and I said I could pay for it (which was my plan anyways until my dad unexpectedly offered an hour prior.) Ultimately I agreed to do more research and get a second opinion (I presented it like my primary doc had just suggested it today so the idea was coming from a doctor versus from me internetting for a few months.) I also asked her to talk to her friends and read some links I sent her, and I think when she does she will find out maybe they had something else done, or she was wrong about their weight, or whatever, and that the odds of me succeeding with this tool are greater than what I could hope for with diet and exercise alone. Also, just because them paying sounded nice, but I am too stubborn to have my mom saying yes/no over my own health decisions, I may make a deal with my dad (the peacekeeper of the family) that I pay for the surgery, and if 3 years out I lose and keep off x amount of weight, they reimburse me. That will also give me extra incentive to lose and keep at it. 


That was a lot, thanks for reading.

Surgery the best option?,"Iâ€™m 21 F. 210 lbs. I gained 70 pounds on birth control my first year of college. I blew up like a ballon, Iâ€™ve tried dieting , working out. I have lupus so working out is kinda hard for me since itâ€™s so easy for my joins to swell up to the point where I canâ€™t move. 

My mom had gastric bypass and said that itâ€™s an option for me but Iâ€™m pretty afraid of going under the knife but idk what to do."
Concerns (7 mos post op VSG),"Hey WLS fam,

I'm feeling really sad.

Good news is I lost 108 lbs total now.

Bad news is I got diagnosed with osteoarthritis and it really hurts to move or even type this right now.

I'm just feeling really discouraged.

Any words of advice from our wls chronic pain peeps?

Dumping 5 days post op because of protein shakes?,"Hi! I had gastric bypass surgery 8/21/19. I came home from the hospital on the 23rd, and was advised that I only needed to follow the clear liquid diet until I got home, and then I should switch to full liquids. Yesterday 8/24 I decided to incorporate one premier protein shake into my day- I was taking little sips of it throughout the day. I was also having water and broth, so this was my first full liquid. I had a really hard time getting myself to drink anything at all in the hospital so Iâ€™m starting slow.

A few hours after Iâ€™d began sipping the protein shake, I had my first bowel movement since before starting the clear liquid diet *before* surgery and it was, well, gross and liquid-y. I thought thatâ€™s just how it would be and continued with my day. Later in the afternoon I found myself running to the bathroom one or two other times and the same thing happening. Nothing painful, just sort of urgent. Again, I thought it might just be normal because I hadnâ€™t strayed from what the doctor had approved for me

Itâ€™s now about 6 am and Iâ€™m basically stuck on the toilet due to very loud gas/liquids coming out the back

I know the premier protein shakes have 1g of sugar, and the clear ones have 0g- could that 1g be why I feel sick?

Could this be because of the protein shake, and if so, would it be safe to stay on my clear liquid diet for longer? I started it on 8/19. If I did go back to clear, I would then switch back to premier proteinâ€™s clear drinks, I had just figured it was time to switch to full."
WLS Options Including Medical Tourism,"After much deliberation, I've decided to get VGS and have my first appointment with a bariatric clinic on Thursday. I am currently hovering around 40.5 BMI and am currently doing Weight Watchers. I have a call out to my insurance plan to see if they cover the surgery, and my first choice would be to have it locally if it is covered by insurance. If not, I'm also considering MX. It seems that there are many fine clinics/surgeons to choose from there. I would also consider out of state clinics in the US who may have self-pay packages. My biggest hesitation and concern is if I were to have trouble finding follow-up care back home, and if insurance will cover any complications that may occur (these can happen anywhere.) I'd love to hear from others who have explored these considerations and what you decided to do.

I'm so excited to begin this new chapter of my life!"
VSG Surgery July 14... tips? Advice?,"Hello! 

I have been working toward this moment for over a year, and am going to be have my sleeve procedure on July 14! 

I am super excited however my doctors office hasnâ€™t really given me anything pertaining to lost op. I am currently on the pre op liquid diet and have attended nutrition classes where theyâ€™ve talked about things like how to shop, and donâ€™t drink water when eating etc. I also know my doctor is much more strict with his post op diet. Ex, no milk for 1+ year... 

I was wondering if anyone had advice for post op dieting? I know the stages of liquid purÃ©ed but I still feel like Iâ€™m walking into something that Iâ€™m not prepared for...

Any advice would be amazing!"
7 months post op- calorie intake &amp; feeling dizzy?,"Hi yâ€™all 
Iâ€™m 7 months out, 120 lbs down and feel the best I ever have. Iâ€™ve found lately that I am a bit hungrier than previous months- Iâ€™m consistently hitting between 900-1100 calories a day, which gives me super anxiety as my nutritionist told me 900 was the baseline. 
Also- lately upon standing I get very light headed, see stars and feel faint. My protein intake, vitamin levels and water intake are all great."
First major NSV: restaurant booths,"I'm only 3.5 weeks out of surgery and down 44 pounds already. I took my son to McDonald's for breakfast before preschool. Scrambled egg for me, pancakes and sausage for him. He picked a booth in the play area and I slid in just fine! I can certainly get used to this."
"I should be happy, but instead I'm scared and anxious.","I had my final visit with the surgeon on Tuesday. I technically qualified to have either the bypass or the sleeve. I could tell he was politely nudging me towards the bypass. He review the results of my endoscopy and it showed some redness in both my stomach and lower esophagus. I had GERD a few years back and it was very miserable. there's a part of me that doesn't want to chance going through that again. so the choice should be easy just do the bypass. But I'm so afraid of developing vitamin or mineral deficiencies. I'm also afraid of dumping syndrome. I know that's part of the tool and it will help me stay on track, but it sounds so awful I'm afraid to experience it, I'm scared it will happen at work or at a family outing and I'll never be able to fully enjoy these gatherings again due to fear of what to eat. I also have issues from time to time with tendonitis and the go to treatment has been Advil that won't be an option going forward. I know it's also restricted with the sleeve but it seems as though you can use these medications sparingly with the sleeve but not at all with the bypass. I'm just having a really hard time making up my mind. my mind keeps focusing on all of the negative aspects of both options. I almost wish the surgeon was able to just say that I don't qualify for the sleeve and I can only do the bypass. It was already so hard to make the decision to have weight loss surgery I feel like I can't handle making another major decision."
I missed face to face Friday. 343 to 208 (vsg 11/8/18)...38 more to go! I finally feel like I dont look old af.,
Has anyone with Barrettâ€™s esophagus/other esophagus issues gotten vsg or other wls?,"I have problems swallowing and I am diet visit 4 of 6. They JUST NOW have told me I need to have an endoscopy because itâ€™s been two years since my last one. She kinda has me freaked out about it. I donâ€™t remember if I was diagnosed with anything on my last one, I just remember it wasnâ€™t cancerous. Iâ€™m trying to scramble to get my endoscopy but now Iâ€™m terrified theyâ€™ll say Iâ€™m not a candidate for surgery. Has anyone had an esophageal problem been denied? Iâ€™m definitely trying to get this surgery before February 1st as my benefits roll over. Sorry if this is a mess of writing Iâ€™m kinda upset right now."
[TMI] Weight loss and chafing 'back there',"So I had my wls just about a year ago, have lost 130lbs and very happy with the results and my increased physical ability.

One downside however is that when I get even a little active, the mini folds around my now deflated buttcheeks seem to chafe real bad, and this gives a really weird feeling as though I've popped my pants. Not to mention the swampass like sticky feeling down there. This is really frustrating, and barring heading to the toilet every hour to have a wipedown, how do I deal with this issue? Is this common or is it unique to me?

Sorry for the TMI."
Question about psych eval,"Tldr: failed psych eval, can I still get surgery? 

So around January I started the process to get wls, preferably the vsg but haven't gotten that far yet. My first dietician appointment was Jan 18th with a follow up Feb 18th. I lost about 10lbs by February 18th but when the dietician looked at my logs she asked if I was depressed and expedited the psych eval, telling me to get it done as soon as possible. I did, and the appointment didn't turn out so well. I just wanted to be honest, I wanted to do this all right so when he asked me about things I told him the truth. He ended up saying that he was going to send a letter of recommendation to my doctor that I do not get the surgery. I almost passed out, I begged him not to, he said I need therapy. I immediately called the doctor's office and asked them if I could get a second opinion, and they said that even if I did the doctor would go by the first recommendation. My next dietician appointment is the 18th again and the wait is killing me. 

Has this happened to anyone else? Does this actually mean I can't get the surgery? Has this happened to anyone and they we're still able to get the surgery? 

My whole life doctors and family and counselors told me it would get better if I lost weight. I was just emotional and I need to loose weight. Almost like loosing weight would magically make everything better. Well I'm finally trying and seeking professional help because I realize I need it, and their saying the complete opposite. I'm so angry and sad. /rant"
Bread an Starches,"So, following surgery, once we get to eating regular foods, Iâ€™m curious about the role of bread.

Often, it seems like bread is made to seem like straight up poison that will wreck your digestive tract

Is that actually true or is it just that bread has little nutritional value and simply fills you up when you could be eating something more nutritious.

I havenâ€™t touched bread yet mainly because Iâ€™m scared that my pouch and intestines are going to freak out.

Is a couple of square inches of pizza crust or a slice of toast going to hurt me or is it just the fact that itâ€™s empty calories!"
Worried about picky eating,"I'm in the pre-surgery process, doing my monitored weight loss, etc. One thing I'm really worried about is the fact that I'm a super picky eater. I have weird food aversions and have a hard time making myself eat new things--if it's something where I have a strong enough aversion I'll gag and not be able to eat it. A lot of the foods that are on the post-surgery diet suggestions are things that I don't currently eat (scrambled eggs, tuna (or any fish), cottage cheese). I'm really worried that I'm going to either not be able to eat anything after surgery or that I'll turn to the things I know and like but that aren't helpful for weight loss.

Questions!
- Are there any picky eaters out there who've succeeded with WLS? How did you find things that you like that are still healthy?
- Has anyone successfully overcome strong picky eating habits? How?"
Should I have stalled after 5 weeks?,"Last Saturday I weighed in and for the past week and a half, there has only been a fluctuation of a few ounces every day. I know everyone is different, but is this normal? 

One thing I realized yesterday is that even though Iâ€™m making sensible choices in the cafeteria at work (and eating very little of it), Iâ€™m not really sure about calories. I got my first REAL workout in yesterday, but I donâ€™t expect to see those results for a few days.

Just curious if my body is trying to figure out why Iâ€™ve dropped 30-40 pounds in the past month."
5 months post op and gagging after eating,"This is something that's only been happening the last few days and I'm not sure what's causing it. I'd made shrimp ""tacos"" with shrimp, pico de gallo, guacamole, and green chili's and I noticed it would happen a lot after eating that, but just now it happened after I had some hamburger patty. 

There's no nausea associated with it, I don't feel sick, I just get this weird urge to gag, and sometimes I do. Today I actually though I was going to vomit, though I still didn't have any nauseous feelings. 

I tried to make sure I ate slowly and chewed well, but it still happened. 

Has anyone else experienced this?"

Twisting lady parts??,"So long story short, but I seem to have a cyst on one ovary that has suddenly grown in size and may be causing my ovary to twist possibly compromising blood supply. I get more details on Friday. I knew that shifting body parts was a risk, thatâ€™s been explained to me several times. Any other ovary owners out there have similar stories out there?
(Stats: down 151 lbs since pre-op, surgery May 2017)"
Do people recognize you now?,Iâ€™m starting my wls journey possible date is November. There are a lot of people in my life who have only known me overweight. Once you loose 100lbs do people recognize you?
Plantbased People?,I currently eat primarily a plant based diet with a little fish or eggs sometimes. Iâ€™m getting sleeved May 24th. My surgeon was pretty supportive of sticking with it. Has anyone had any experience staying plant based after surgery?
Update on being sent home in the hospital from putting to much weight on.,"Ok, so I made a post a bit ago about being sent home wile I was in the surgery prep area. They had to take my IV out, that's how close I was. I weighed in at 235 that morning. I was sent home because my goal weight was 224 and according to the scale gained 11 lbs. Well, I was super bummed for obvious reasons. Got a bunch of people saying that it was all my fault, blagh, blagh, blagh. Well, I got weighed a week later at another Kaiser, the one I normally go to. I weighed in at 226.1. I know I didn't loose 10 lbs in one week so a few things may have happened. 1) I absolutely was bloated and retaining water. That possibly could have added 4 lbs.  The scale from the location was usally about 3-4 lbs heavier than my home scale. Combined with a weight gain of 2 lbs. So, I totally could have got the surgery done if I wasn't retaining water and if their scale was calibrated correctly. All that being said. I still have to get back down to 224. I can absolutely do that no problem. I feel a bit vindicated because I KNEW I didn't put on 11 lbs. I fucking knew it. Any way, the 2 lbs I did put on was totally my fault. I stopped swimming as much and had been very tired from this whole process. So, I slacked off at the gym. My fault and I own it. Going to get back into the gym and get these 2 lbs off. Thanks to everyone who was supportive."
Getting my RNY Wednesday May 8th. Nervous but excited!,"So here's my story. I've been big since I was 12. I hit my high weight of 523lbs  in 2015. I've always carried weight well and it never slowed me down, but once you get over 500, everything becomes so hard. I found I was starting to plan simple things like walking across the house to minimize back and knee pain. It had to change. So I started logging calories which helped me get down to 480ish for a while. In summer 2017, I accompanied my wife (who was about 400lb at the time) to a consult for her abdominal hernia. The surgeon said at her weight, there was nothing he could do for her. This was a wake up call for both of us. We learned you could be refused a life saving transplant due to being too overweight. How had this never come up before?! She made the decision to join the WLS program at the hospital where we both work. I was still not ready though, thinking I could just try to keep pace with her without having the surgery. One of our first decisions was to give up meat, dairy and eggs and be 100% plant based. We found it wasn't really that difficult for us as we had already been trying to limit those things, and as chef in our house, re-learned how to cook. My wife began losing in earnest, documenting everything and attending the series of classes the WLS program requires. I just kind of remained stalled until August 2018 when I finally conceded that I needed more help than I thought, and I joined the program as well. My wife met the goal her surgeon had set for (she was now 350 lbs) and had her RNY on November 7th 2018. The same surgeon had set my goal at 400lbs, meaning I had to drop 86 lbs on my own. With my wife's surgery already over with I was feeling the pressure to not be left behind, and the support from fellow classmates in the WLS program, and from the dietician and psychiatrist visits (also part of the program) I finally started making real progress. I've worked harder for this over the last nine months than anything in my life. On April 18th I officially met my goal (actually weighed in at 393!), and got my date of May 8th. Today is my last day of regular food. All liquids starting tomorrow. This will be my first surgery and first time under general anesthesia. My wife set a high bar for me. She missed a total of 3 days of work, maintained her vegan diet, met every milestone, and her labs look great across the board. I hope I can do the same. She is kind and caring and I could not ask for a better support system. I keep reminding myself how safe this surgery is, and that I'm ridiculously lucky to get to have it at a famous medical Center that is frequently rated the best in the world. It is going to be okay, and I can't wait for my new life.

Failed IUD (pregnant) 6 months post op,"So my copper iud failed (expelled into my cervix, baby is fine, iud now removes)  and weâ€™re keeping the pregnancy but Iâ€™m really worried about nutrition and vitamins! I found out earlier this week and need to call my surgeons office ASAP Monday but has this happened to anyone else? My weight loss hasnâ€™t been rapid like many peopleâ€™s so that puts my mind a little at ease but this was a total (good) surprise and Iâ€™m just wondering if anyone else has gone through the same thing and what it was/is like?


Edit: I already have two kids so this will be our third and last, so Iâ€™m not worried about first time parenting"
I way overate yesterday and I feel crappy about it.,"Iâ€™m very worried about stretching my pouch. I did t eat any amounts too big in a sitting, but I was eating all day and combines several things that shouldnâ€™t happen in the same day so my carbs were very high and my protein low. I ended up hitting probably 1500-1600 calories throughout the day. I was active in the morning so I donâ€™t think I can actually gain from it but it scared me that I fell into that grazing pattern that sends so many people backwards. 

Today Iâ€™m restricting and considering a liquid diet to get me back where I need to be and make sure everything contracts as it needs to. I am just beating myself up because I feel like a lost control I have worked so hard to build. "
#facetofacefriday! Down 80lbs so far over the past 6 months! :),
"Never succeeded at dieting, always rebound, would I fail at wls?","41 year old male. BMI 43.

Ive been generally healthy for years, even while big. My blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol numbers are all good.

I've tried a handful of different diets and I've yo-yod heavier each time. I'm so afraid to keep trying for fear I'll keep getting bigger.ive done fitness pal, and food tracking, and I can never keep up withe cognitive load. 

The weight issues are finally starting to pile up. I don't feel healthy so I don't exercise, and I'm craving bad food very frequently.  My waist size is around 50in and finding clothes that fit is becoming difficult.

Ive wondered if WLS could be helpful, but as I read about the careful dieting and watching the scale, etc it brings up memories of failure. I'm terrified of screwing up my guts and failing in the discipline required post-op, same as I have every other time. 

Anyways, kind of a dump. Figured others here may be able to relate. I feel like a grownup in a lot of ways, but not around food/weight. And while WLS seems like it could be helpful, I'm afraid I'd fail at it too, and the consequences would be severe."
"Hmm...an odd, and unexpected NSV.","So, turns out I DO have veins in my arms...LOL

What does it feel like when youâ€™re having complications with your gallbladder?,"So Iâ€™m in the pre-process of surgery and Iâ€™m pretty good with everything that comes with it, except when thereâ€™s an issue happening with the gallbladder. **I want to understand what it would feel like if there were a gallbladder issue.** Iâ€™m afraid that Iâ€™d just think I was feeling under the weather when actually something serious is wrong. I know it doesnâ€™t always happen, but Iâ€™d like to know as much as I can. 

Any personal experiences with what happened and how it turned out might help my anxiety too. 

Thank you in advance!"
Under 300,"I went below 300 on the scale today! My HW was 340, and my surgery was on 4/8. Iâ€™m so excited! Iâ€™m going to get a new Fitbit to celebrate!"
Keeping food hot?,"So now that I'm on stage 2/3 of my diet, I'm working again on taking my time between bites and extending my meal duration. But the one issue I run into is that no matter how hot it starts out, it's ice cold midway through. 

What do you do for this? I guess reheating it is an option, but it just seems annoying."
Dating thoughts,"Iâ€™m not at all ready to start dating again yet (Iâ€™m about a month post-op, and at this point I barely have the energy to get out of bed and eat my 600 calories) but I was having a conversation with a friend that brought up some thoughts and questions. 
At what point in your process DID you start dating? As soon as you were more or less recovered from the surgery? Did you wait until you had lost the weight? Had plastic surgery if you were going to?
How do you feel about the different demographic youâ€™re attracting? For example, I like bigger guys and Iâ€™m not sure theyâ€™ll be as interested in me when Iâ€™m smaller and I canâ€™t eat with them. Thoughts from former big guys on that one? What about the sense that these people wouldnâ€™t have liked you when you were heavier? Is that weird?
Any other thoughts on how dating was affected/changed appreciated."
Weight gain after A different Surgery?,"So I finally got a hernia I have had for years repaired. IT was a HUGE goal of mine because I've had it forever but could never get it fixed because of my weight. Well today I stepped on the scale before Surgery and I was 339, I had finally broken the 340 mark after a 2 week stall. I go this morning, have surgery, wake up in typical pain, get over it, get home. Later in the day morbid curiosity I stepped on the scale... and did it 3 more times wishing I didn't. 347 lbs. a nearly 8 lb gain..... It's a massive blow to my ego and my mentality. Is this due to the surgery? Can you gain that much weight instantly from hernia surgery?"
"NSV: If I fits, I sits.","I have pretty major body dysmorphia so just see my pre-op body no matter how much weight I lose. I was taking my daughter on a theme park ride and noticed parents who looked smaller than I am have to get off bc the safety bar wouldnâ€™t lock into place.  I started to panic, told my daughter we might not be able to ride, and was prepared to be humiliated. 

I fit!  Barely, but the bar clicked more than once and off we went.  It turns out roller coasters still suck, but my kiddo was happy so I was happy too."
It finally happened. 3 months post op and I'm starting to enjoy vegetables,"I have never been much of a vegetable person. Growing up my mom didnt cook 99% of the time and the 1% of the time she did, it was horrendous. I grew up eating pizza hut, cookies and McDonald's. I'm fairly confident there were years of my life on end that I went without eating a single vegetable. As an adult I started being able to eat some vegetables but only in certain situations. I could eat carrots and celery in stew, I could eat peas and carrots in fried rice, bell pepper in Chinese food. But I never loved vegetables. I tolerated them. 

I was sincerely hoping surgery would change my taste and I would like them. But when I woke up nothing was different. It sucked, but I thought it was just one benefit I was not going to have.  

Well, it took three months but it's gradually started happening. I've periodically tried something new and just realized I was cool with it. I now enjoy asparagus as a side with my steak. I eat plain raw bell pepper like it's potato chips. I just tried broccoli for the first time since surgery, something I vehemently hated preop, and I liked it! I bought a bunch of raw green beans and am hoping to fit those in soon. 

This surgery has done so much more for me than just losing weight. It's changed my life. My relationship with food is so much better. I would do it again in a heartbeat."

Too many calories daily?,"Hello all, I am two months out today, 12/20, from gastric sleeve.  My calories are anywhere between 600 to 950 depending on the day.  Usually 800 to 950 calories if I had to pinpoint it.  Mostly protein.  Am I too high in calories?  Iâ€™m worried about it obviously.  Thanks ahead of time.

Switching surgeon,Has anyone had to switch surgeons after being approved? The one I have now seems more and more disorganized and terrible at answering questions and still wont schedule me for surgery. 
Hernia??!??!?!,"Got my sleeve on 2/26. The restriction is doing its job, my appetite is fine, getting my vitamins, recovering, but my main incision area still really hurts. The area near it, down in the muscle... The skin parts seem to be healing up just fine.

I'm worry I've been overdoing it walking, and getting in and out of bed. The pain got markedly worse when I tried to roll over in bed... That was a huge mistake. And it's a pulsating pain, a standing-up-but-not-sitting-or-lying pain.

I've got my follow up scheduled for Friday so I know they can palpate or do imaging, but did anyone have a hernia in their large incision after a sleeve? How did it feel? How hard was it to have fixed?"
Stalling, I was sleeved on 11/26 and for the last 2-3 weeks iv been going up and down between 7 lbs. I dont know if im not eating enough or what im doing wrong that im not losing. i have a premier protein shake with my coffee for breakfast. 3 oz of meat/fish and an oz of veggies for lunch. usually almonds for a snack around 230 then a meat/fish and veggies (4oz) for dinner. i drink about 48 oz of water a day or more and i exercise at the gym (30 mins on the elliptical and weight machines). what am i doing wrong?!

Loma Linda Bariatric Surgery says my insurance requires 6 months of monitored Dieting at a BMI of 35 to 40(HELP!),"As the title states, I had to attend a seminar after being referred to the Loma Linda Bariatric hospital. The seminar was great and very informative and I asked a lot of questions, including monitored dieting till the surgery date as per request to my insurance.

 I have never been able to find anywhere that states for IEHP that a person with a BMI of 35 to 40 with co-morbidities or 40 to 50 to require a monitored diet and follow up for 6 months before surgery. I have even contacted my insurance and asked questions and they told me a guideline to be approved for bariatric surgery and they didn't state that. But the Loma Linda hospital is saying it's something my insurance requires to be approved. 

Anyone else have an issue similar??? I even asked the surgeon that was attending the seminar, If I have a BMI of 41 but have to go through the monitored diet for those 6 months, will I still be approved if I lost weight to not let me qualify. And she said yes because they only use the first weigh in. I just don't understand why I'd have to do 6 months of a diet if my BMI isn't above 50? "

In need of a pep talk,"Hey WLS friends. Just had my sleeve surgery Wednesday and I pretty much had non stop vomiting for the first 48 hours. Just got home from hospital today and am having a really hard time. If a few people who had a rough start could chime in and tell me itâ€™s gets better that would be pretty helpful. Thank you!

Can you throw up?,"Almost 3 years out RNY. I have a stomach bug today and I am so nauseated! I've been dry heaving for an hour. This is the first time I've been sick really since RNY but I'm thinking about it and even if I over eat, I don't actually throw up. I either end up with dry heaves or spit up some food and that's it. I can not actually vomit since having RNY. Anyone else?"
Got my surgeon consult and my nutritionist appt dates.,"I am going through the Fresno Kaiser for the Sleeve. I was told that I would be given my target weight loss goal at my appt with my surgeon. I have started my ""diet"" in the orientation booklet that I was given on Monday to try and loose as much as I can before my consult with the surgeon. I am trying to be at or at least in the ball park of the target weight he will give me. I am swimming laps 30 min a day and am at or just below 1,200 calories a day. My appt is on June 3rd. Did you do anything specific to drop some lbs to reach your goal weight?"
1 day post op and the retching is killing me,"I got sleeved yesterday, and I wonder if anyone has dealt with wrenching like I have?

New iv bags hung = painful retching
Medications put into iv = painful retching

Tiny sips of water = painful retching
Taking meds = painful fetching

I havenâ€™t actually thrown up, but going through the retching is extremely painful. Iâ€™m now afraid to sip water or take meds.

Is this normal? Or should I call my surgeon?

Update: Iâ€™m handling water much more easily now. The last time I retched was taking my liquid pain meds. Thanks guys. I guess I just needed to vent lol"

Post-op Gas,I haven't been passing any gas and I was wondering if it will go on its own without me having to pass gas?

VSG &amp; Acid Reflux,"Did anyone have the sleeve who has experienced acid reflux and not have any major issues?? 

I did have a doctor once tell me I had GERD, but I've never been on daily treatment. I take things as needed. I can say that my teeth in the back have damage from acid over time, so I'm sure I do have GERD - but it doesn't impact me daily. 

I know my surgeon will decide what is best, but I'm really hoping to do the sleeve. RnY scares me and I'm not sure I can go through with it. I already have intestinal issues and I don't like the idea of my insides being rearranged."

"Surgeon approved me yesterday, so now RNY or DS? Male 6'1"" cw 523lbs","36 year old man here. I've completed my six months of weight loss appointments and was cleared by the surgeon yesterday to proceed with surgery. This entire time I've been preparing for RNY. My mom had RNY a few years ago and did fantastically well. Three of her sisters have since had RNY done. I've never considered anything other than RNY. Yesterday at my appointment with the surgeon, he mentions that Duodenal Switch is also an option for me because my BMI is so high. My starting weight was 585lbs as of 6/30/18. Current weight as of 2/21/19 is 523lbs. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, it through me for a loop and made me have lots of questions. I'm now worried I'll make the ""wrong"" decision and regret my choice. So those of you who decided between the two, can you please provide insights on your decision-making process? And those who went with DS, are the gas and bowel movements manageable?

The psych was very helpful and said that the office will probably have everything together and submitted by the end of this week. A few weeks ago, the dietician told me that my insurance (Medical Mutual) usually is really quick at responding and never takes more than a week for approval. I could be getting a surgery planning appointment and surgery day for RNY very soon!!! How long did everyone here wait for submission and approval? How long after that was your surgery date?

Bariatric vitamins and FSA/HSA,"Does anyone know if you use your FSA or HSA account to pay for bariatric vitamins?   I understand they can be quite expensive

Has wls helped your pain?,"I have a lot of pain related to my weight. Itâ€™s hard to believe that it will go away when I lose the weight. I have stress fractures in my feet, plantar fasciitis, fallen arches, bunions, and knee pain. Which is kind of crazy considering that Iâ€™m only 26 years old. I desperately want to do things like run races with my friends and go hiking, but my pain is often too crippling. 

So, for those of you with weight related pain who had surgery, did the weight loss help your pain? How long did it take after you started losing weight before your pain started to decrease? How did your activity levels change after surgery?"
When was the last time you didn't recognize yourself? My husband caught a photo of me at an angle today that seems like a dream.,
"Final Review Complete, No PreOp Diet?!","Yay! Met with my surgeon on Wednesday and he says I have completed everything and his team will be submitting my paperwork to insurance! Now the wait begins.

He did mention that he will not have me on a pre OP diet like he normally would. He says I'm not big enough or unhealthy enough to need one. I was a little concerned about that and his handout does show what he typically asks of his patients for a pre op diet. Is it bad that I am wanting to do it anyways?

All he has asked is I don't gain weight and liquid fast 24 hrs before surgery. Just seems odd and Dr. V, whom I watch a lot of videos of, warns that you should always do a pre op diet. I'm conflicted."
"After a year of nutrition appointments, exercise classes, support group meetings, life skills classes, and more I've finally been submitted to insurance! But, I keep reading about RNY complications and now I'm scared I'm chickening out...","So I probably need to stop googling things, right? But the more I think about it the more I worry that I will be one of the people hit with life-ruining complications, or that recovery will not be truly possible. I mean, right now I'm very obese(high weight 450lb, currently 399lb), but I can still live my life. I almost want to call it all off. 

I am a stay-at-home mom to very active 2 year old twins, I can play with them and chase them around and lift them and provide all the care they need. I can keep my house clean, walk an okay amount, and I have no comorbidities. My mental health is good, and with the help of medication and all the classes I've taken I've really changed my relationship with food. But I know no one stays at 400lb without there being consequences. I also am aware that it is basically impossible to lose that amount of weight and keep it off with my level of sustained obesity. 

My husband will be able to stay home for a week or two after the surgery but then he will go back to work and I have no friends/family in the area who can help out. I know I won't be able to lift my boys into car seats or to their booster chairs or pick them up. I'm not sure how I'm going to have the energy from weeks 4-6 of recovery to take care of them while I am also healing? I read these accounts of people who are almost bed-bound for years after, tired and grey and lacking energy, throwing up all the time, unable to function. I'm so scared that doing this will take me away from my family, make me unable to care for them. I know the alternative (diabetes, early death, etc). 

I'm sure I'm not the only person to be in this spot, and would really appreciate any words of wisdom you guys could share."
Help - dealing with fatigue and going back to work!,"I'm going back to work after six months off.  

Before I  left my energy levels were all over the place and nearly every day, right after lunch, I get EXTREMELY fatigued and feel all I can do is lay down and nap it off.

I still have that problem and foods are really hit and miss how they affect me.  One day I can have my vitamin packet with a tiny amount of fructose as the flavoring, the next day I drink it and I get dumping.  One day I can have my coffee with soy milk, the next day - dumping.  

(btw I know coffee is frowned on by doctors, but outside of unsweet tea, it is the only unsweetened beverage that I can have that wakes me up.  I drink like 15 bottles of water a day so it is not really dehydrating me) 

Protein is a struggle always - so I am trying to plan for a ""sustainable"" work schedule from the time I leave home till the time I get to work and come home. 

I am also a scattered person so putting food in my face in the morning sometimes gets forgotten and lunch is usually not premade at home unless I am having a super amazing week where I am on top of everything.

Any tips - I am teaching sixth grade again so I'll be on my feet or sitting on my butt 50/50.  The place where I work is surrounded by fast food places -but there is also a natural food grocery and restaurant not far away. 

**Help help help! I REALLY need this job and if I start passing out or getting really sleepy/logey people will notice.  With the legalization of MMJ here, I am afraid they are going to think I am high and fire me.** 

How do you cope?

(I firmly oppose MMJ at work with kids or while driving.  Anxiety and such aside, I've seen educators who do it and the kids know.  Especially kids from low-income backgrounds and it makes adults seem a little less caring and more like the reprobates in their own lives that treat them badly when they are obviously high.)"
Insurance is requesting additional information from my physicians about my weight.,The insurance company is requesting progress notes (showing my weight) from the last 5 years. The problem is that the Primary care physicianâ€™s office I used during that time has permanently closed.  I was with that office for several years and before the doctor I was with before them lost her license. I know I can get information from at least 3 of those years from my gynecologist. But I missed a year or so... ugh Iâ€™m so disappointed right now.  Thankfully Iâ€™m off work tomorrow so I can figure this out.  Any suggestions?
Has anyone been on keto Instead of the pre op diet?,
Waiting for insurance,It's been a little over a week since the clinic submitted my stuff to insurance. Im getting impatient and anxious. How long did it take for you guys to find out if you got approved?
Confused about portions!,"So I can have a 1/2 of food now. I was planning on having crab and a sweet potato/carrot mash. 

Should the total amount of food equal that? It seems like such a small amount, so want to make sure Iâ€™m okay!

I wish I could just use a food scale!"

Did anyone else have to write a letter to their surgeon to get approved for surgery?,"So the way Kaiser Mid-Atlantic works is that to qualify for wls, you have to:   

- Get a referral from your pcp   
- Attend 2 90-minute group nutrition classes   
- Attend 5 one-on-one individual appointments with the nutritionist   
- Attend 2 information sessions with the surgeons   
- Have an individual consult with the surgeon   
- Get a psych eval   
- Get a sleep apnea test (and have 75% CPAP compliance if you have apnea)   
- Get a stool sample tested for something (I think she called it pylori? And if you test positive, you have to take antibiotics and wait 4 months)   
- Wait 6 months total to get the surgery, even if you complete all the requirements sooner      
- Lose 3% of your weight if you work in DC or VA, or just maintain your current weight if you work in MD   
- write a letter to your surgeon explaining why you want wls   

Then, after youâ€™ve done all this, your materials will be submitted to a committee to make the determination as to whether they think you are eligible.

_______________________

**So, right now, Iâ€™m in the process of writing my letter to the surgeon. The problem is that I feel like Iâ€™m giving him my entire life story. Iâ€™ve literally written 3 pages already. Iâ€™m wondering whether anyone else had to write one of these. If so, how long was it, approximately?**   

**Did you:**   

**A) Go into all the gory details of how you became obese to begin with?**   

**B) Talk about how your obesity is affecting your life, and what it will mean for your quality of life to get the surgery**   

**C) Talk about how grateful you were for the opportunity, and give reassurances that you would be compliant**    


**Or some combination of the above?**"
What is it like eating after surgery?,"I started my two week pre-op diet on the 10th. My surgery is next Tuesday. I have not cheated at all and have been following my surgeons orders to a T. Cravings haven't been bad but boredom with food certainly has. 

I am having RNY. What is it like eating after surgery? Are you satisfied with eating? I know that we don't really eat to feel full any more but is eating still satisfying? I just want to stop drinking protein shakes and have some real food."

Anybody else have a hard time getting comfortable?,"So I had my gastric sleeve surgery on the 6th of May.
I am currently ~25 lbs down.

Im finding my old sitting positions to be uncomfortable. In fact whenever I sit down, it feels like my left ribs are poking me somehow.

Anybody else experience this? I doubt itâ€™s something I can â€œremedyâ€ and my body probably just has to adjust, I just wonder if itâ€™s common and when it will end!"
Very limited on what I can eat,"I'm almost 6 months post-bypass. I've done well, being 45kg down so far.

However, I am incredibly restricted on what I can eat. And not just in the volume sense.

I cannot eat the following without vomiting: all meats, eggs, all fish and seafood, bread, rice, most vegetables, most fruits, leafy salads and lettuces, anything battered or breaded, wraps, protein shakes, smoothies and pills (I'm on liquid vitamins).

I'm basically living off of yoghurt, cheese, potato and small amounts of pasta. Soft, slider foods. It's almost impossible to get a decent amount of protein in.

Did anyone else have issues like this? How long was it before your pouch became less fussy?"
Not eating enough?,"I was sleeved on 11/26 and for a typical day i have my protein shake with my coffee for breakfast around 8am, a cheese stick around 10am, a 4 oz lunch usually consisting of 3oz of of some meat and 1 oz of veggies, some almonds at 230 then for dinner 3 oz of meat or fish and 1 of veggies. Iv been going to the gym every other day doing 30 mins of cardio then weight machines. i feel like i keep going back and forth with the same 5 lbs and im not sure if maybe im not eating enough or what i can do to drop faster. I hit maybe 700-800 calories a day and iv been keeping my carbs under 30 g and getting about 80 gs of protein. "
The thing I miss most is Subway,"I live on a college campus with a small food court. I walk by subway and am tortured by the sweet sweet smell of their baking bread. I would never cave, but boy do I miss those toasted foot longs. Anyway. Stay strong fellow wls friends!"
Got an appointment,"I made a post almost a week ago on how I was 6lbs away from a 40 BMI, but was conflicted on whether I should gain the weight. Well, I ate a bunch of food, drank a lot of water, put on my heaviest clothes, and just made it! 

I have an appointment scheduled for this Tuesday to meet with a doctor at the weight center. They gave me some forms to fill out about my weight history and eating/exercise habits, which Iâ€™ve already completed.

From what I understand, this weigh in got me an appointment, but I still need to meet the weight requirements on Tuesday. I just hope that Iâ€™m able to maintain it, and that Iâ€™m able to wear the same clothes, not some gown or whatever. I mean, if I donâ€™t make it, are they really going to kick me out, if a few days prior, I was fine?

Iâ€™m excited, but nervous. Iâ€™ll be much happier when I can eat like normal again. I may be overweight and eat my fair share of junk food, but this is way too much. I feel so bloated, and itâ€™s difficult mentally, as well.

Thank you to everyone for their replies on my last post. :)"
Mood stabilizers + Roux en Y,"Hello, I asked previously about which (if any) of my medications are safe to take. I'd like to know if anyone has any experience with mood stabilizers specifically? What can you take after surgery? From my googling I can't seem to find anything that you can have for mood stabilizers, only antidepressants. If anyone has had this problem too or knows of a source it'd be great to hear from you. I'm afraid of reverting back to my unstable depressive episodes after surgery."
Creative ideas for coping with the pill crushing phase of 0-2 weeks post-op?,"I am 5 days post op (VSG) and, all in all, things are going really well so far.  But the one aspect of this process is that is sapping my spirit is taking medication.  I don't know if this is standard, but my surgeon puts all patients on a trio of pills (anti-reflux, something to prevent gall stones, and anti-nausea).  On top of that, and the anti-clotting shots, for reasons relating to my own personal case, I also have to take 2 different blood pressure meds and an antibiotic to deal with a recurring leg infection which thought it would be fun to spring up while my immune system was distracted dealing with this surgery.   So, in total, that's 8 pills per day (two have to be taken twice).  Under normal circumstances, this is no big deal, but these are all swallow-able pills, and I am currently prohibited from swallowing any of them.  So, that's 8 pills I need to grind up and a giant mountain of disgusting, bitter dust to shovel down two times a day.  And now my doc wants me to add a daunting amount of miralax powder to the mix twice a day.   

I'm at the point where I'm almost gagging every time I have to do this.  I've tried mixing it with sugar-free pudding, jello, and applesauce.  It's not helping.  And my sleeve won't allow me to just chug 12 ounces of soda or juice to scrub the awful taste and dry powder out of my mouth.  

I'm sure I'm not the only one who has struggled with this issue.  Does anyone have any creative tips for how to make this process tolerable?  Or is this just one of those ""it sucks but it will be over soon"" parts of the process?  Of all the things I expected to make my recovery extremely unpleasant, this one was nowhere near the top of the list!!!"
So many questions about: Gastric Sleeve - LSG,"Yesterday I had my first consultation with a bariatric surgeon. He was very lovely, looked at my past medical history, my own weightless attempts, and we went from there. He suggested that having a gastric sleeve would be my best option. He assured me that I would have far less problems with the sleeve opposed to the band (still offered here in the UK), balloon, and bypass. So that's where we are. He's asked me to see a dietician, attend atlas 2 of the weightless support sessions, and seen a psychologist to make sure that I am fit for surgery. Once I've done that and sorted the payments out, I can then have bloods taken and then the surgery itself. All seems reasonable, and I'm happy to comply. I asked him the questions I had at the time, and now I have even more! If anyone can help I would be grateful! And to hear your experiences and journeys would be great!

&amp;#x200B;

How did you find the surgery and the recovery?

How did you feel about it being non reversible?

How did it make you feel overall?

How are your portion sizes at the moment?

Are you still able to enjoy the foods that you previously enjoyed?

Have you had any complications?

&amp;#x200B;

If there's anything else to add please do. TIA!"
Anyone else put on Topamax/Phertermine combo because they stopped losing?,"I'm about 2 years post op from a SIPS.  I had my first consultation around 240 pounds (I'm 5'5"", btw), had the surgery at I think 210? (can't quite remember anymore) then slowly lost about 5 pounds a month until I hit 170 and then just stopped losing altogether.  The doc advised trying more protein, less protein, more fat, less fat, more carbs, less carbs, more cardio, less cardio, more weight training, less training, and every combination thereof.  I once saw 168 after being sick for 2 weeks, then went straight back to 170, and for a week after Christmas I was 172, then went back to 170.  I'm solidly in that band and can't seem to budge.

About 6 months ago, they said hey, let's try putting you on metformin just to see what happens.  We did.  Nothing happened.

I went in for my lab work check up last week (which is always just fine except for my usual low iron, which is something I struggled with even pre-surgery), and this time she said ""how about we try a combo of phentermine and topamax?"".  Well, I've been on it for a week and...it's not what I had hoped.

Funny story is that our scale broke and we're in the middle of a snow storm and can't go get a replacement, so I have no idea if I'm losing weight or not. Besides that though, I was told that the phentermine would give me energy, and if anything it's the opposite.  I've always been a low energy person (losing weight hasn't helped at all), but this past week is just absurd.  Thankfully I work from home and can take short naps during the day then continue working in short bursts, otherwise I'd have to use up vacation time just to sleep.  It does seem to help with appetite, I guess (I need to log how much I'm eating now, because it sure doesn't seem like much.  I'm fitting in my required protein shakes, maybe a few bites of dinner, then back to bed).  I was hopeful that the Topamax would at least help with my migraines, but so far it's had no impact.  I've also noticed that I need to stand up slowly otherwise I get super lightheaded.

I just don't see the point.  If it doesn't help my headaches, and doesn't give me any energy, and I'd just gain it all back once I go off it (and she said they'd take me off it after 3 months for at least a short period)...what exactly is the benefit? Do I just need to give this more time?"
Different instructions? Are carbs the devil?,"Hey all, Iâ€™ve been told different things by different nutritionalists and am really curious! How many carbs do you eat in a day? Do you avoid like the plague? One told me to eat 40, one told me 70, and another told me every meal no more than 15g each (which is odd because we are suppose to eat 3-5 meals..) and that daily count doesnâ€™t matter. What do you do?"
"My husband had a phone consultation with the dietitian today. We have not had surgery yet, so this was the initial conversation with her. When she asked him his weight, he told her, and she responded with, ""Oh, I'm so sorry."" How is pity an appropriate, professional response?",
Weighed vs volume,"So I've been seeing some differing opinions... when you say 4oz of food... is that 4oz weighed or 4oz of volume? Someone got on my case because I weighed out some food to be 4oz, but they said I should be eating 4oz or 1/2 cup total.

My nut has it written out in plan to do XXoz protein, XXcup veg, XXcup grain. So I'm assuming I'm weighing the protein and measuring the rest... not trying to just cram my whole meal into a 1/2 cup measure. 

What do you do?

Hiatal Hernia?,"I wanted to pick anyone's brain on something that happened to me last Thursday. I woke up in the morning at about 5:45 and made coffee for my family and noticed some achey-ness in my chest. I thought it was weird, but passed it off as just being sore or tired. I made my own coffee and breakfast (which I pack to eat at work) and came back to my bedroom at about 6:20. When I got there the ache I had been feeling was noticeably more intense so I sat on my bed and in doing so felt what was perhaps the worst pain of my life right under my sternum around my diaphragm. It was bad. I've never had a feeling like this before. My wife was trying to get people to watch our kids so she could take me to the ER and there were about 2 minutes when the pain had peaked that I thought I was dying. Then it just sort of eased off. In all, I want to say it was maybe 20 minutes of actual pain. I was sore, I went to my GP who sent me to a cardiologist who ran a stress test that day and the next day did a radioactive something or another with a stress test. I haven't had the feeling come back since. I have some soreness under my right shoulder blade, but I've had that before (I think I pulled something or have a cyst growing in there, once and a while I do something to aggravate it). My question is, has anyone had a problem with a Hiatal Hernia? I have heard that some people after weight loss surgery/massive weight loss have issues with it. My Dr's seem to think it was my heart as the symptoms do sound that way. I got the results from the test on Friday and it didn't put my mind to rest either. The Dr. said there were some irregularities as there was a shadow over my heart. Either the shadow is a problem with my heart, there's something behind the shadow which he thinks is caused from scaring from my surgery, or the third option which is who knows, there's a shadow and I'm fine.

I'm 32 (33 on the 19th :D) I had the Duodenal switch December 26 of 2016. I started at 535 lbs and I'm currently down to 320 lbs. Other than this, I have been generally great! I haven't had to worry about blood pressure pills or diabeetus medication since the day of then month after surgery respectively. "
How do I get over last meal mentality?,"I recently got approved for surgery on the NHS (currently 406lb) and since then Iâ€™ve had this last meal mentality where having got my portions under control and actually to a point of gradually losing weight since the approval every where I go out with friends Iâ€™m eating loads again as if itâ€™s my last meal, as if I can never enjoy these foods again.
Iâ€™m trying hard to control it but wondering if anyone else had the same feelings and any tips for getting past it and getting ready for my surgery in the next 6-18months (NHS hasnâ€™t given a date yet just said approved)"
What can you do about all the hanging skin after you lose so much weight?,"I am very large and short so Iâ€™m worried that after I do the surgery (gastric bypass)  Iâ€™m going to have a lot of loose skin hanging. Do you get a skin graft? Is it the only option? Or what else can you do to tighten the skin? 

P.S I know I am getting ahead of myself as I havenâ€™t had the surgery yet but Iâ€™m just very curious."
Don't feel like eating anything,"Hello! I'm on my 4th week and have been eating mushy food for a week and this week I can eat normal food as long as I feel up to it. I just don't feel like eating anything, I can eat at most one sheet of ham in one sitting (2 minutes in-between bites of course). I developed a hefty dairy intolerance and my diet before was very heavy on dairy. I just eat ham, eggs (maybe 1/4 of an egg) and sometimes crisp bread with ham. I'm just not inspired and feeling down I guess. I'm very good at drinking my water though which I'm happy about. I don't want to eat anything with a lot of suger in it or something that has too many carbs I'm so afraid that I'll just stop loosing weight forever if I eat the wrong thing haha ( I know it's not like that but it always is in the back of my mind)"
Did your program give you good dietary guidelines for when you can eat normal food again?,"Mine didn't. I was cleared for normal food at my one month post OP appointment and given a one week sample menu. Was told to get in my protein and water and ""listen to my body"". I asked several times for calorie guidelines but the nutritionist refuses and tells me it's impossible to overeat at this point. She also won't give me any suggested portion sizes other than ""3oz of meat"". I'm almost 3 months out and my weight loss is good, but I am so nervous that I'm going to screw this up. Right now I eat 750-900 calories a day and almost always get my protein in, but I feel like I'm just fumbling in the dark here. I never know I'm full until it's too late, and I'm terrified if I get full at every meal I'm going to stretch my pouch. I've tried to make an appointment with another nutritionist but was unable to. It's extremely frustrating. Is this the norm, for them to just leave you to figure it out on your own and I'm just overthinking?"
How much can the stomach stretch after the sleeve?,Of course I am  most concerned with the long-term. the short term Iâ€™m OK with even the next couple decades. Of course I am concerned about when Iâ€™m in my 50s and 60s. Can you share insight or knowledge in this area
Gaining weight and looking for motivation/kick in the ass,"I had the sleeve on 9/12/18 and Iâ€™ve lost 64 lbs. Started at 283. Iâ€™ve just hit a plateau and Iâ€™m not losing and recently gained 5 lbs. Iâ€™ve been screwing up a lot with the diet and just canâ€™t seem to get out of my head.  I walk 5 days a week. Any tips would be appreciated. 

Also I began taking risperdol (sp?) in December and I feel like that has been causing me to snack more mindlessly lately. Not an excuse but just wanted to see if anyone had the same experience with this."
Heavy weightlifting,"Hi all! Iâ€™m very new to this process and still researching bariatric procedures. One of my favorite methods of exercise is powerlifting. Is this something that will still be possible months after surgery? I would be paranoid about tearing or causing injury from stress to the area. 

Again, Iâ€™m just starting this journey so I would ask a doctor what would be safe. I just didnâ€™t know if anyone could validate my question based off of personal experience!"
Payment options for surgery,"I'm not really sure this is 'allowed,' but I've been looking into GBP, but my insurance documents online say they won't cover weight loss surgery. I'm curious what dollar amount I'm looking at for doing this without insurance? Also any tips for getting it covered? I'd love to hear if someone's plan said they wouldn't cover it, but ended up doing it anyway. I more than qualify for it on a technical level, and on top of that I have PCOS. Thank you!"
Discomfort when eating? Near upper left hand side beneath rib?,"Iâ€™m about 6 months post op, I donâ€™t remember having this feeling before and it typically happens when Iâ€™m eating. I only ate 1oz of chicken and slightly under 1oz of green beens before feeling the discomfort. I know before, I would get hiccups or a runny nose but not much discomfort in my side. Does anyone else get this??"
I have my surgery date!,"March 11. If there's a word for terrified and excited at the same time, I'm that."
"Surgery (VSG) date scheduled, have almost exactly a month to prepare...","But, I'm worried I don't have enough prepped and ready for the surgery and life afterwards. 

I'm a very big guy (5'9"" and 515lbs) and this surgery is going to really put me on a better path, but my support program prior to my surgery has been a bit limited. It's predominantly been about getting authorized for my insurance and they've given me direction on a pre-op liquid diet and a support group that meets once a month but it just doesn't feel like much. I'm not sure if this is pretty standard or atypical for most programs.

I've focused on trying to educate myself with YouTube videos and a couple of channels there seem to have a lot of good content, but I need to figure out some things I can put into practice now. I've started replacing a meal a day with a protein drink to start incrementally ramping up to the full liquid diet, cleaned out the fridge and looked up recipes to start trying to cook, and started trying to walk a bit more than usual to keep my stamina up. I still just wonder if this is enough or if I should be doing more as I'm not getting much direction from my surgeon. 

I travel/fly quite a bit for work so for at least two weeks in this upcoming month, I'm going to be out of town and at a client location so I'm not sure how that will impact things but I can't imagine it'll help keep a routine very well. Thoughts on what else I can do to get myself as prepared as possible?"
cycling instead of walking?,"I'm scheduled for surgery on 2/28 and am also in the middle of training for a 60 mile bike ride in June 2nd. I'm not super worried about intensity of riding, so much as i just want to keep riding. My rides average 30minutes to an hour right now. If I keep my pace moderate and the intensity low, is there any reason I can't cycle instead of walking?   


The surgery center I'm going to has a support facebook group where they kind of warned me off any serious training for 6 months so im trying to gauge how accurate that is."
Percentages of excess weight lost - a question.,"When the comparisons show 80% of excess weight lost with gastric bypass, or 70% with gastric sleeve, etc - whatâ€™s the cause of that stopping point, typically?"
My turn for a stall,"Down 108 lbs since last July, 6 months out from RNY. Went from 3-4 lb loss per week average to 1 lb down each week for 2 weeks and now I've been at 212 for 2 weeks. That said, i know this is normal, I lucked out and didn't really stall at all before this. I'm getting 72 oz water daily, minimum 64 oz protein, focused on low carb/ low sugar/ healthy fats. I've also just last week started to be more consistent with my weight training at the gym and I'm starting this week - it's quite possible I'm in a perfect storm of hormones and water retention over here. This too shall pass, not stopping at the gym and hoping for a little ""whoosh"" end of next week. I'll get through this!"
Rollercoasters!?!,"How soon did your doctor say you could ride rides with g force? Has anyone experienced riding rollercoasters a month after surgery? My doctor said 4 weeks post op but I'm worried it's too soon. Also, excited about trying it. "

Waiting To Start and Finding Issues That Weren't There,"I posted awhile ago that I was starting the process for wls. I have to wait 2-4 weeks for the program to get my detailed insurance breakdown and schedule me for the first appointment.

Since this process started I have found myself going off the rails with food. I thought I'd had this under control. I was on a kind of ""lazy keto"" way of eating previously but since this process started I've found I am eating out constantly, eating candy and whatever else. 

Did anyone else go through this? I don't have any stress in my life right now really so I wouldn't be trying to cope with anything really. Unless I'm all worried that I won't be able to eat this stuff again (which sounds so weird to type this lol.) 

I just don't want to end up with them going ""Nope no surgery for you cuz you ate all the things."" or something weird."
Uh oh- 6 week complication!,"Keep up on your fiber people.

Lapband Port Pain/Possible Infection?,"I've had my lapband for about 4 years now. For the last year, I've had some serious pain around my port. I had my surgery in Atlanta and then moved to LA almost right after, so I'm not 100% in love with my doctor here like I was in Atlanta. Haven't been able to get fills because my doctor thinks I might have an infection in my port (despite me not having a fever or anything else). Has anyone ever had this or anything like it? It's really uncomfortable and I've been feeling so down on myself because I've GAINED weight and now am more than when I got my surgery.

2 more sleeps,"Tomorrow I travel 4 hours away from home with my hubby to his parents place, spend the night there. Then Monday at 8 am arrive at the hospital.

This should help with so many of my health issues, like blood clots, re-flux and asthma. I've been on Optifast for 5 weeks now. I'm down about 30 lb just on that alone. It's not been easy having nothing but liquids but I'm making it work. The first week was horrible with the kids and hubby still eating and me sitting off with nothing. I wasn't able to be around them while they ate. Was just too hard on me. Now I can see others eating and not want to tackle them to the ground and take what they have and either toss it out or eat it myself. I think I've got this.

I have been looking into different options and came across the duodenal switch. I was wondering if anyone had went from the sleeve to this option. And how itâ€™s worked out for you?"
Did you have a nicotine serum test?,"I am pre-op for RNY and just completed all of my requirements...still waiting on insurance submission and approval. My question is: how many of you had to be tested for nicotine? I am a former smoker and I have been (mostly) honest with my doctors that I quit almost a year ago. Ok so I have had a few smokes here and there because my BFF and my husband still smoke and hand them out like candy. Anyway, will I have to get a nicotine serum test before surgery or will they forego that since I have told them that I quit? Did anyone have a positive nicotine test that delayed surgery?"
Frustrated at bariatric office,Hey everyone. As the title says Iâ€™m pretty frustrated with my doctorâ€™s office. My insurance company called me Friday early morning to let me know that I am approved to have my VSG surgery (yay). I tried to call my doctorâ€™s office to let them know and to see what my next steps were. Well they didnâ€™t answer at all on Friday even though they are open 8am-4pm. I tried calling every hour and nothing. Iâ€™ve also tried calling today throughout the day and no answer either. I just feel frustrated at this point and worried that maybe theyâ€™re unreliable. I mean how is anyone supposed to schedule an appointment at this office if they wonâ€™t even answer the phone.
RNY patients.,"So I was told I do not qualify for the sleeve per my insurance but I've been approved for the bypass and I have a date of June 19th. I've been doing a lot of research here lately but figured I would post and get your take on a few things. 

1)how hard is it to take pills post OP? More so vitamins.

2) what's something you wish you knew before you had the surgery?

3) what can I expect my life to be like post op?"
Protein shakes/powder without artificial sweeteners?,"My surgery date is in a few weeks and Iâ€™m getting more anxious about finding a good protein shake/mix that doesnâ€™t taste strongly of artificial sweeteners which I very much dislike. Iâ€™ve tried the Premier Protein and Muscle milk and theyâ€™re sickly fake-sweet and I canâ€™t imagine having to live off of them during the pre and post op liquid diet. 

Iâ€™ve started looking at other options but itâ€™s extremely overwhelming as there are billions of choices out there. Any suggestions for not-so-sweet protein drinks? Hopefully something with less that 6 grams of sugars per serving?"
"I want to grow out my hair! Hi everyone, I am 6 weeks post op VGS but before surgery I went in to get my hair cut and the lady did a horrible job so in order to fix it i had to go shorter...anyone know if this is safe to mix in my protein shakes with my new stomach?",
NSV and it was awesome,"So I just experienced a non scale victory that I once never dreamed was possible. I went on a date last night after the date he invited me over to his place to hang out. We were cuddling on the couch, etc. and I realized it was 11 pm. I was like I need to go we both have to work tomorrow and I donâ€™t want to keep you up late. He looks at me and says â€œor you could just stay the night?â€ I was excited for a moment then realized I had zero clothes with me and wore a very fancy dress I couldnâ€™t sleep in so I was going to be sleeping in the nude if I stayed. I weighed my options and decided to stay. We walk to the bedroom and he says â€œLet me grab you one of my T-shirts to sleep in.â€ My man weighs like maybe 215-220 and is over 6 ft so not a big guy at all. I have never been small enough to wear my guyâ€™s shirt and the awful feeling of omg itâ€™s not going to fit came rushing forward. He hands me the shirt and I put it on, not only does it fit its loose and comfy. I almost cried with tears of joy. I am now one of those women who can steal their manâ€™s clothes to lounge around in. Something I could have never even imagined 10 months ago."
Sleep apnea questions,"Hello everyone. I took a home sleep study about two weeks ago as part of pre surgery work up. I got a call from the office asking me to make an appointment with the sleep specialist. Everyday of my life I sleep fine with 7-8 hours. I fall asleep fine, stay asleep fine, wake up feeling rested, don't feel tired during the day. I am however extremely picky with my sleep environment. I have to have everything just right ( lighting, temperature, background noise, etc.) I'm concerned if they tell me I need a CPAP I'm going to end up sleeping worse. Does anyone know if it's an option to just say no, I don't want to use a CPAP or will somthing like that cause issues with insurance coverage for the surgery."

Bypass or sleeve surgery? Questions in general,"Hello everyone. I'm 21 and morbidly obese. It is due to inactivity and love of eating, so nothing wrong biologically. I am considering surgery, and my doctor offered me these two types of it. Can you guys enlighten me on their advantages and disadvantages?

I fear long term damage. What's gonna happen when I'm 65? Is my body going to function okay with a missing part or a complete skip of one? Also, will I be able to enjoy food like I do right now? What will be different in my life? These are overwhelming me. 

This will be my first surgery. It mentally feels wrong to let people get inside me and modify my organs, but I guess this is what I have to do. I don't think I can sustain a good diet and exercise routine sadly."
11-year WLS post op,"Just joined Reddit so I really have no idea what I'd doing, lol. I'm 11 years out post WLS. Had the band in 2008 and had to revise to the sleeve in 2013 due to a slip and complications. Had my son in 2012, followed by a lower body lift, arm lift and breast aug. And in 2018 gave birth to surrogate twins. Currently maintaining a 150lbs weight loss. It's been an amazing journey. If anyone is considering it... it's lifechanging.

Happy 1 year Sleeversary to Me ï¿½ï¿½ 50kilos down and 6 dress sizes,
Entering soft food phase soon and looking for recipes.,"Liquid portion post op is almost over thankfully. Not been hard, just boring. I am looking to start prepping for what I can eat during the soft food phase. I prefer savories over sweet. Is there a good place for recipes? Maybe I'm searching wrong, but I don't see much on youtube. "
Surgery worried and scared,"Hello all, my sleeve surgery,is in a few day 8-14-19 and I am so nervous I feel like I dont want to do the procedure no more, I  am worried how I'm going to feel and also worried if I would  enjoy food like I used to, I  need some advice please I also have high anxiety.thanks"
Doctor wants me to choose between Duodenal Switch and the Sleeve,"I've been lurking here a lot and was hesitant to post but here it goes, I suppose,  


I'm in the motions of getting bariatric surgery and I met with the surgeon and nutritionist and all and I was leaning towards the switch because my BMI is 59. The problem with it that he brought up to me is that I take a lot of meds for depression and PTSD and he said that I may not absorb them like I should if I go that route. He said that I needed to do some research to which would be the most beneficial for myself.  


My question is, has anyone else gotten the duodenal switch and takes a handful of meds? And how does that affect you? I know I'll have to take vitamins regularly for the rest of my life and I'm ready to do that, I'm just so confused and wanted to see if anyone else has already experienced it. Thanks so much in advance! "
Just donâ€™t want to eat,Tomorrow I will be 3 weeks post op RNY. I just donâ€™t want to eat. My doctor progressed me to the soft food stage on Friday and most days I maybe have an egg and some purÃ©ed chicken salad. I try to drink protein shakes but Iâ€™m so sick of them at this point. I have no ambition to eat anything. I am keeping up with my fluids. I feel so worn out and Iâ€™m guessing thatâ€™s because of the lack of nutrients. Any advice would be appreciated. 
My wife's journey so far,"This is my wife's experience written by her. She is looking forward to hearing from this community. Since she started this journey I would read her your stories and show her the progress pictures to help keep her enthusiastic about this. Sorry about the formatting, I'm on mobile. 

I don't want to discourage anyone from getting the surgery. To be honest it has given me a head start at life. I mainly looking for opinions on where to go from here... Here is my story: I had gastric bypass October 8th, 2018 and revision November 21st, 2018. I had a kink in my intestines and small pouch that appeared in my suture line. Between the two surgeries the surgeon placed in a stent from my new pouch through the top of the intestine to try and straighten out. It last almost two weeks until I had a bad dry heaving episode and it was dislodged. Then they placed in a Nasal feeding tube. Which I had a bad reaction to. Choking and gaging if trying to talk, burning acid feeling in stomach. It was removed during the second surgery. After the second surgery I had some normal complications, a stricture(took 5 endoscopies to stretch) and a ulcer (healed in 1.5 months) I continue to have pain in my pouch. I haven't moved past the soft food stage for fear of hurting the pouch more. 80% of my intake is followed by nausea and vomiting. Because of  dehydration and severe malnutrition (massive hair loss/tooth decay) the Dr's decided a gastronomy feeding tube in my old remanant stomach would be best. I was dishacharged with no instructions and had major pain and was directed from the on call nurse for the feeding company to go back to the hospital. During my ER visit they said everything was normal and pain was from inflammation. Now, five days later I have refused to take narcotic pain meds for fear they will make me dry heave and cause more pain.  I have bad pain and pressure from the tube feeds and have halted them and am now back to where I started with no food or water intake. I am back in the hospital and their new CT scan shows Mal-placement of the tube (too close to the new pouch) and air pocket around the tube as well as the nicked my bowel while placing the tube. I have asked for a complete reversal. The Dr put the option of reversal on the table a month ago which I didn't want to. They are now saying a reversal can cause more issues since my remanant stomach is basically dead. My insurance tells me I can't see another Surgeon because the way my plan is set up. I have come so far, but I can't keep up with this quality of life and its not fair to my family."
Deciding on WLS,"This week after doing years of research I have decided to talk to my doctor about having weight loss surgery. I want to do the sleeve. I am a type 2 diabetic who is close to 240 lbs at 5'4"". My concern is that I am on Medicaid (Oregon Health Plan) and i fear they will not cover it. I spoke with a doctor about 4 years ago who said absolutely not but I've since changed medical plans thorugh the Medicaid program and am hoping that I'll get a different answer. Has anyone had experience with this and how did it go?

Another question I have is regarding the psychological exams they want done. What does this entail? I do have anxiety. Is this a deal breaker for them?

I am currently maintaining a keto diet which has drastically gotten my blood sugars under control but I have yet to experience weight loss from it and I am wondering what the transition from keto to the wls diets are like if anyone has done such?

Finally (though I'm sure I'll have more questions.) It says that people usually go back to work 2 to 4 weeks after surgery. Is this a hard rule, like I couldn't go back to my desk job right after?

Thanks in advance for your help! I've already learned quite a bit from ya'll here and am looking forward to the process oddly enough. "
Wls and personality change,"Hey everyone!  First off I got to say that this place has been so helpful in my journey!  I had rny 5/10/19 and Iâ€™m currently down 60lbs!  So far I really feel like I made the right choice.

However,  I am still fatigued a lot and having stomach pains consistently.  (Hitting my protein goals and taking my vitamins)  Also the most alarming problem is I feel like my personality has changed dramatically!  I used to be super out going and social.  Now I feel like itâ€™s a chore going out and being around my friends, who are really supportive.  I feel like I should be having the opposite problem and not now being more of a shut in!  Has anyone had a similar experience with personality changes?"
Getting off cpap?,"I'm 3 months out from vsg, have lost 70 lbs total, and really feel like I don't need my CPAP machine anymore. I've been sleeping without it quite a bit because it's annoying to me now, and I feel like I sleep better without it now. I kind of hate it now lol. My husband was the one who identified I might have sleep apnea due to my gasping and snoring, and he reports that I now sleep soundly without the cpap. 

So for those who've discontinued cpap due to weight loss, what is the process?  I talked briefly to my primary doctor about it before my surgery and she said to wait until my weight stabilizes then have another sleep study. That's all well and good, but that could be like another year... I don't want to use this thing for a year if I don't have to. What happens if I just stop using it?  

Thanks!!"
Calling all post op 12 hour shift workers!,"Iâ€™m 16 days post gastric sleeve, down 22 pounds, and Iâ€™ve been feeling great! Iâ€™m still in nursing school now and work as a patient care aide (12 hour shifts on a high acuity aka busy floor) in the hospital. While Iâ€™m taking 6 weeks off of work I have to go back to clinicals at the hospital tomorrow. These clinicals run from 7am to 3pm and while theyâ€™re busy theyâ€™re not AS busy as a shift while working. My question for yâ€™all is how in the world do you do it?! Iâ€™m trying to plan out how Iâ€™m going to be able to get in all my minimum water and minimum protein for the day while constantly running around answering call lights! It seems impossible to me so Iâ€™m looking for any advice!"
RNY done on the 25th March 19... 7 stone gone since the start of my lrd!,
Last test before surgery approval. Anyone else have low ferritin and successfully brought it up?,"I had my last test today before being cleared for surgery. I had a low ferritin level of 7 ng/ml (regular is 11-307) during my bloodwork that was done after my first consult back in April. I've been taking a daily women's vitamin (I was not previously) and just got tested again today. This is the absolute last thing I have on my pre-op checklist and now I'm crossing my fingers to get approved for the bypass surgery.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else successfully bring theirs up? I am so ready to get this surgery and be in the other side of this anxious pre-opp time where I'm so worried about gaining weight, or not following some rule and getting denied surgery. I'm also only at 90% compliance with my CPAP and I hope that doesn't disqualify me either.

&amp;#x200B;

This waiting game sucks!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Just got back the results (damn that was fast!) and it only went up 8... ugh hopefully I don't have to wait even \*longer\*"
What do you know now as a post-surgery individual that you wish you had known before surgery? What questions should I be asking my doctor and dietitian? Preliminary appointment is this week.,
Well Yes Soups...Okay for Phase 2?,
Anyone else have Cigna?,"So I have cigna for health insurance, and I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar situation. My request was denied only (or so they say) because we did not have the sign off from my primary care doctor. That paperwork is being uploaded and there is a peer to peer review scheduled with my surgeon on Thursday...Has anyone else been through this with cigna? And if so what was your outcome? I'm scheduled for surgery on the 20th and they said they will have a decision 24-48 hours after the peer to peer  review but I'm still very nervous. I'll be pretty devastated if after 6 months of hard work, endless doctors visits, and 2 endoscopies plus probably over 1k spent so far I get denied."
Surgery was successful!,"Not really having gas pains and not farting, so hopefully I will still be released today. Iâ€™m able to drink things now, first 24 hours or so was nothing by mouth."
I want to do a takedown,I am tired of not being able to enjoy a meal or get proper nutrition. Any help would be greatly helpful
Blood clots,"Hello! I had my surgery Monday 7/15. Overall I feel decent. I have some gas pain in my abdomen as well as soreness. Iâ€™ve been passing gas and sipping water all day, still canâ€™t drink an entire protein shake so I know my protein isnâ€™t where it should be but Iâ€™m focusing on staying hydrated. 
I also was given Lovenox shots for the next 10 days, which I have been doing. Iâ€™m a little paranoid about blood clots. Iâ€™m constantly walking (went shopping today) and just casually walking around my house. I also have been using my breathing â€œairlifeâ€ thing. Is there anything else I can do to prevent it? My surgeon said itâ€™s rare as long as you follow directions."
Is this normal ?,"I have noticed a lot of people complaining about vomiting and not being able to hold more than 200 calories per days during the first week or so post laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy .Weirdly enough , I only vomited once and that was on my discharge day after I chugged down water quickly . Now after 1 week post op , I am comfortably doing 500-600 calories per day ( I am still doing liquids ) . I had oat soup today , and it comfortably settled in my stomach . My stomach makes this weird gurgling sound sometimes, but I havenâ€™t really experienced any sort of pain that suggests I am eating bad or that I should stop eating . Did my surgery go wrong or something ? I havenâ€™t weighted myself since before surgery by a week , so I am not sure about weight loss results."
How much time after surgery before vacations?,"Hi all. I'm currently in the 6 month pre surgery diet, which will be up at the end of March. So I'm hoping for surgery in April or maybe June, depending on how long it'll take to get me approved. 

My question is this. I'm currently planning my summer vacations. Typically we take a lot of little long weekend camping trips (in a pop up trailer), then one week long trip in a cabin. We're hoping to go to an amusement park during our week long trip, but other than that I'll be able to take it easy. We like to relax on our vacations :). I'm also hoping a weekend trip in Chicago which will involve a lot of walking. That one is definitely July 24th. 

How much time would you allow after surgery before booking a trip such as this?  Even if I have the surgery on June, should I be ok to go camping in July?  What about the Chicago trip?"
RNY Dec 2017 HW:325 CW:210. 16 months and one baby later and Iâ€™m feeling pretty good :),
I've got my date... Help!,I've been waiting 3 years for a surgery date (NHS in the UK) and now I've got it I'm freaking out! If I had the date this time last year I was in a really good head space and I'd be all for it but right now I'm just in shock. I'm unprepared. I've put on weight. I'm supposed to be moving. Someone just tell me it's all going to be OK!?
A little update (more for my sanity than you all),"I had a Mini Gastric Bypass on Monday May 13th. The pre-op diet was a breeze and I never had issues with it, which surprised me. The post-op diet might kill me though. If I put another protein shake or powder in my mouth I think I may just end it all. I've been subsisting on strained soup and just not eating. Not the best course of action, I know, but my body had a violent negative reaction the other night while brushing my teeth because the toothpaste was the same consistency as protein shakes. I have gotten so lethargic and light headed the last day or two and I know it's because I'm just not eating anything. As soon as I put anything thicker than water in my belly I can feel my blood sugar ride and I feel a ton better. I had my surgery done at LIMARP in Tijuana Mexico, beautiful facility and wonderful surgeon, but they didn't give me much as far as post-op instructions. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on where I can get nutrition that isn't in protein shakes or powder? Does anyone have a good suggested post-op diet plan starting when I can start adding foods to my diet? 

Also, as an FYI I started my pre-op diet on the 7th at my all time high weight of 370lbs and weighed in at 345lbs this morning, the 18th. More than likely will hit 30lbs lost in 2 weeks in the 20th."
"Face Gainzzzzï¿½ï¿½ Also, FYI, 3 years out and REGAIN is real! Pic on right is after losing 25 lbs of my 30 lb regain! Canâ€™t wait to continue! Keto is working itâ€™s wonders!",
Day Two : Still sucks,"Still in the hospital, thankfully stopped vomiting blood. They tried four different anti- nausea meds before we found one that worked. Don't be afraid to tell them something feels wrong. They initially didn't realize how much I was vomiting and I think it was close to a liter of blood throughout the day from what they were able to measure.

So pros are: can drink small amounts of water without getting nauseous, not in much pain which is nice. I was throwing up from tablet tylenol so the switched to IV. Godsend really.

Now, if you're queasy do not read past here:

Instead of vomiting blood I'm now pooping blood. My blood counts are down a lot so there may be a bleed somewhere in the GI. Hopefully not, but I can't even walk right now because when I stand up my heart rate goes into the 150/160s and if I'm walking it's 170s/180s which is basically  tachycardia. 

Not regretting the surgery yet but this is very frustrating. Thankfully the nurse team has been awesome. And the surgeon team checks up on me every few hours which makes me feel better that they're aware of everything going on."
I'm confused as frak.,"So I eat right, Count my calories, Work out, and my weight struggles. It stalls and takes forever to drop, it can be frustrating, like now, I am STRUGGLING to get under 330. I've been 332 and 331 for 3 weeks now. I had a small bump up to 333 recently. I sat for awhile and though as my Birthday was coming up but I said to myself well it's going to most likely cost me another pound but I'm going to the movies, Getting a free popcorn, a candy and a diet drink and I'm going to enjoy my birthday. That's EXACTLY what I do. I get a medium pop corn, a Large diet drink and a Reeces candy bag and I eat nearly all of it. Yea I have some regret but a lot of resolve to keep fighting the good fight to lose weight. I get up the next morning and weigh myself and WTF?!?! I'm back down to 331... how?!?!?! I just had a bag of candy, Movie theater popcorn and a huge diet soda.... how did I lose 2 lbs? AAARRRGGGHHHHHH!!!!!! I'm so confused.... no.. I'm not going to start pigging out.. I know working out and eating right is the way to go.. it just makes ZERO sense."
Stomach/throat gurgling - any tips to lessen?,"So I'm getting so self conscious about my throat gurgling. I work in a quiet office and it's SO LOUD, and I'm sure my coworkers can hear it. It happens a lot when I drink any liquids and I hate to say it but I feel like I'm at the point where I'm avoiding drinking just to avoid the noise. I can't figure out what type of drinking (too fast?  Too slow?  Too big a gulp?) is triggering it, or if it's just random. 

Anyone have any tips to minimize it or hide it?  Did you explain it to your co-workers?  I'm not ""out"" about my surgery at work so I don't know what to say."
Wish I could get the tightness back.,I'm 2.5 years out from my RNY. I have lost a 145 pounds but I am no where near goal yet. I still have another 50 or so pounds to go. I'm not losing right now and I know it's because of food choices and pushing my portions right up to capacity. I know how far I can push before I get sick and I've been pushing right up until that point. I eat too much and I eat the wrong things. Some days I think about the tightness of right after surgery and how I was forced to stay in control. I had no choice but to be strict. I want that back at least long enough to lose another 50-75 pounds.
Energy pre-op vs post-op,"I'm on day 10 of the pre-op diet. Last week sucked but I was pretty much fine as of Friday. I'm still hungry a bit but I just keep chugging water and that helps. 

My problem is that I have zero energy. I went to the gym the other night and had to stop halfway through my workout. My daily walks, which used to be easy, are killing me. I know a lot of people complain of no energy during the pre-op diet, but how does that change post-op?  Or does it not?  If I'm getting even less calories won't I have less energy?  I know we're supposed to walk as much as possible as soon as possible, but I can't imagine having much energy for that after surgery!!

Tell me your experiences with your energy level post-op."
Donating clothes- so scary,"Iâ€™ve decided to stop wearing my too large clothes and just donate them and get a couple more things in my current size and do laundry more frequently. It feels like a really big step, but itâ€™s time because my old clothes are a 3x and Iâ€™m wearing a non plus size xl now so they look crazy on me! Iâ€™m terrified!
UPDATE: Went shopping at OldNavy and got four inexpensive dresses and four inexpensive t-shirts to go with the three pairs of shorts and two dresses I got a couple weeks ago. Itâ€™s enough that I can do laundry about once a week and be happy!"
"A little face to face friday! 7mo post rny, down 97 pounds",
Gastric bypass and Alcohol,"So last night I was out with friends, I had quite a bit of alcohol in total throughout the entire evening.

I didnt feel overly drunk at first, just ""normal"" drunk. And then we ended up going out and ordered drinks, I had mine and after a little while I started feeling very ill. I dont know how else to describe it, just ill. Not really naseous, but clammy skin, weak, fatigued. And then I passed out for a bit. They took my blood sugar, because I have had lots of lows lately, and it was fine. And after some minutes I came to and felt absolutely fine. 

Im not sure what happened here, anyone else have any similiar experiences with alcohol? I know my tolerance is lower, it has been since surgery and I think thats pretty normal."
Help... Just realized I've been putting fresh garlic in pre-op diet broth,"Help ah as title says I've been making a pre-op diet broth with carrots, celery, four cloves of garlic, onion and straining it for the broth. My surgery is four days away and I just realized now. My pre-op pamphlet says to discontinue garlic herbal supplements because they may increase bleeding so I'm freaking out a bit about what to do. Please talk to me."
getting nervous before surgery,"any feedback, input, shared experience is hugely appreciated. i'm sure this is normal. i'm very excited too. but i'm scared i'm going to mess it up because i've never been able to stick with anything before. i'm self pay so i haven't had to jump through the insurance hoops, and all that is required is that i complete a pre-op diet two weeks before surgery to shrink my liver. i'm afraid i won't be able to stick with even that, that i'll break down and mess it up. i know getting the sleeve is different, but whenever i try to eat better i go through this cycle of doing well, followed by a very gradual fizzle out followed by a long period of not caring, feeling futile, and ending up heavier than i started. maybe it's because i'm not addressing that i eat to cope, and that it's my primary coping mechanism. i'm stoked to turn my life around though and ready to do whatever it takes to succeed. 

but right now i'm a little scared, and i've been feeling a range of emotions about losing food as a coping mechanism. it's been my most consistent and reliable source of comfort my whole life (though i know it's literally killing me). i know that   
will change and i'll adapt. i want to try to find another way to cope even before i start my preop diet, but i almost feel as if i'm mourning and trying to spend time with my old friend before they go away forever. i'm afraid i'll feel heartbroken when i wake up from surgery, and that i'll drown in an inescapable wave of anxiety that i can't eat my way out of. this is the feeling that has been lingering in the back of my mind, even though for the most part i'm excited and ready to move forward. most of the time i can beat those thoughts back and stay focused. today was the start of my one month preop window. it's becoming very real. any guidance or encouragement would be much appreciated."
Headaches and tiredness on pre-op clear liquids diet,"Hi! I have gastric bypass surgery scheduled on Wednesday 8/21 at 7 am. Right now itâ€™s Monday 8/19, almost 10 pm. Today was my first day of the pre-op clear liquids only diet.  Iâ€™ve been doing my best to drink as much fluids as possible- three premier protein clear bottles (theyâ€™re 16.9 fl oz each), almost an entire bottle of chicken stock (so nearly 32 oz) and drinking water nonstop. Iâ€™ve peed so many times today Iâ€™ve lost count. I feel sick and full but Iâ€™m afraid of becoming dehydrated.

Iâ€™ve felt increasingly tired throughout the day, and now I have one of the worst headaches ever. Somehow my stomach feels full and somewhat queasy, yet also still hungry. Since this is making me feel exhausted and I have to be at the hospital at 5:30 am on Wednesday, Iâ€™m worried my tiredness will somehow negatively effect the surgery? Iâ€™m not sure what to do from here. 
Any advice would be appreciated, thank you!

Edit: everything went totally fine. By the second day, the all clear liquid diet wasnâ€™t so bad. Incorporating more of the protein drinks definitely helped. Thank you everyone for your advice!!"
Surgery report,"I was sleeved yesterday, 08/19. When I first woke up post-surgery, man the gas pains were agonizing. Up in my top five pain events, along with childbirth, a twisted ovary, and some migraines. I had hoped since I've had two other abdominal surgeries, with air pumped in, and those had no pain, that this would be the same. They eventually got the pain controlled, and I've been steadily improving since then. After I slept on and off most of the day, at night every hour I was awake I would walk the halls and do my spirometer, and the nurses started calling me a rockstar patient ï¿½ï¿½ My first night was in ICU because of sleep apnea, but today I got moved to the regular floor. The greater attention in the ICU was nice, but on the regular floor I'm not hooked up to as many machines, so getting up for the restroom and walking aren't such an event. I'll be able to go home tomorrow. I'm feeling very positive now, but man it was hard the first several hours.

So far I haven't had much trouble getting fluids in. I watched tons of Dr. Vuong's videos on YouTube, where he emphasized that post-surgery we should think of ourselves as hydration machines.

When I first woke up, I felt what seemed like hunger. Then that went away for a long time, and then this morning I couldn't tell if it was pain, nausea, hunger, or gas. It went away after nausea meds, however. So I'm going to try rerouting my thinking so I'm not automatically believing I'm hungry just because I have a similar sensation.

I thought maybe this would help or reassure someone about to get their surgery!

Pain after eating?,"Hey everyone, just had the sleeve on the 5th of August, so I'm 4 days Post-op. 
According to my hospital I should drink protein shakes 1 day after the surgery. I tried it in the hospital, but my stomach would react with pain like 20 minutes after. Water and clear broth are no issue.

Has anyone else experienced something like this? I'm a bit worried, because I can't follow the hospitals plan regarding Post-op nutrition. I hope there isn't something wrong with my sleeve.

Were you able to down protein shakes Post-op? Or did you have a clear liquid phase afterwards?

I'm hoping that if I stick to water and broth for a few more days my stomach will have healed by then, but what do I know.

Thanks for any input!"
Day 2 post op,"It started around yesterday everning a bubbling gurgling slightly burning sensation, itâ€™s only till today I have connected it with drinking.

So Iâ€™m day 2 - still in the hospital and even the tiniest sip of water causes me pain and discomfort, it gargles  and almost comes back up . Forget 15ml every 10 mins I can barely Drink 5.  Any one else get this ? 
Tried to talk to my surgeon who said â€œwell you have a really tiny stomach so you have to drink really slowly. â€œ at this rate I wonâ€™t sustain hydration and it feels like no one cares."
When did you venture out After WLS?,"Iâ€™m headed to the bookstore while my family runs a few errands. Iâ€™m a book lover and was going stir-crazy at home for the past 3.5 days. 


When did you all venture out after your WLS. How was your stamina? I get fatigued really fast, but am drinking pretty well."
Nearly 3 weeks post op,"HW 370 CW 327 Mini-Gastric Bypass. 43 pounds down in 3 weeks, stalled out a bit since starting on the blended foods. I expect the stall to break once my body has acclimated to the food I'm eating. I haven't had a headache since the surgery, small miracle. Weird to not have to take my daily Excedrin. Wounds have healed nicely. Sleep is regular. Weirdest BMs of my life. Looking forward to eating real food again, but also happy with waiting. 

Ultimately, the decision to invest in my future with this surgery gets me more and more excited every day. Can't wait to see what they future has in store!"
Cymbalta After Surgery,"Hi all, I was wondering if anyone had any experience taking Cymbalta after surgery. I visited my psych meds nurse today and she had no idea, and I won't meet with the surgeon again before surgery. Given that it's an extended release capsule, I'm nervous. Also worried because if I have to stop taking it I'd have to wean myself off starting now. I'm already super anxious about the surgery, I feel like changes in my psych meds will make me more anxious. Thanks for any input. "
Considering Surgery but Unsure,"Hello there, 

My doctor has suggested weight loss surgery to me most likely to help my hypertension. I also have a history of heart disease and diabetes in my family, so I recognize I need to lose the weight.

I'm concerned about a few things. I'm very unfamiliar about the whole process so I'm not sure exactly what I'll need, but I'm also afraid I won't be able to enjoy food. I very much enjoy trying new foods and love watching food shows. Checking out new gourmet restaurants is a hobby. Is this just completely undoable after weight loss surgery?

How stressful is post-op dieting? Is it affordable? 

Thank you all for you insight!"

Surgery Postponed for several months,"I completed the program and my insurance approved my surgery. I've met my deductible and am in the 80/20 phase. I also completed my pre-surgery diet. 
However...I do not have the required deposit for the hospital since it is considered an elective surgery.

So my surgery date was cancelled and has been postponed until I can afford the deposit. But now I have to also pay for the pre-surgery diet again which was almost $500. 

I feel embarrassed, ashamed, depressed, etc. There's no options for me at this time  except to work on saving the money. 

Has anyone else been through this? I guess I'm looking for encouragement that  this is just a bump in the road and eventually I'll be on track again."
Wanting to prepare as much as possible,"Hi, Iâ€™m asking my doctor in a few days about WLS, hoping for a gastric bypass, but I have a question ï¿½ï¿½
One my partner brought up as we are hoping to prepare as much as possible before I even see the surgeon so I know what to ask etc
Iâ€™m heavily pierced, I have facial piercings, stretched ears, oral piercings etc. 
I was wondering what did everyone do when it came to taking their piercings out for surgery? Did anyone change them to plastic for it? And if you had to take them out, were you able to put them back in after you woke up in recovery?"

After calling my parents and husband to tell them the news I broke down and cried. Now I cant sit still. I feel like I'm gonna vomit my protein shake up. 
Is this normal? My husband thinks I'm crazy cause I'm finally getting what I want. I'm just...kind of in shock but like everything is so real now and I'm terrified. "
Stall,"Hello all!  I had my gastric bypass on November 8th, 2018 my pre surgery weight was 418. I have been sitting at 353 for the past couple weeks. I exercise daily doing different things at Planet Fitness such as circuit training and the treadmill. I try to get at least 6 - 10k steps per day in also. I feel like I have been stuck at 353 for a while, is this normal? I know that it usually takes about 1 year to get to your lowest weight I just hope that I lose more. I am hoping to some day be at 230 pounds but I am not sure if this is realistic. "
Now I wait...,"Doctors office submitted to insurance on 6/7. I called insurance today to make sure they had all the proper paperwork. They told me they had everything and it could take up to 15 business days to process.

I really hope it doesnâ€™t take that long! Iâ€™m anxious!

My mom is getting WLS and Iâ€™m anxious,"I donâ€™t want to tell her/anyone in my family because that would make them anxious. Sheâ€™s getting a sleeve gastrectomy.

Does anyone have any experience with this? Any words of reassurance, any reality checks to offer? Thanks."
Gained weight during pre- requirements,I gained some weight and Iâ€™m dreading my insurance denying me.. I had all the requirements sent to them last week so Iâ€™m hoping they will approve me.

Pain and uncomfortableness,When did you start noticing that you didnâ€™t have as much pain? Iâ€™m sooo unbelievably sore and burping non stop (which causes more pain). Iâ€™ve been walking as much as I can as well to help with the excess gas.
Will I keep losing? SW:440 CW:340,"I had my VSG the last week of June. My pre-op diet was 3 weeks long and I was able to drop 50 lbs! Since surgery ive dropped another 50, so Iâ€™m down 100lbs and Iâ€™m not even at month 2 yet. Iâ€™m currently getting into the rhythm of working out and keeping to my diet, but Iâ€™m scared that I wonâ€™t keep dropping weight? I donâ€™t know many others who started with a higher weight like mine, I know I might just be a bit impatient but what kind of end result could I expect? Any previous experiences would help."
What will I be able to eat eventually?,"Hello all,

I had my sleeve on the 23rd, and am currently in that phase of eating teeny-tiny bowls of soft and pureed foods. I was just wondering -- how much will I be able to eat in six months time? A year? 

I've no intention of going back to quaffing MacDonald's, but I would like to be able to eat a little bit more than I'm managing now. Will my ability to eat increase as my stomach heals? Or will it remain at this level forever?"
Surgery day,Today's the day. I'm so nervous I have a huge headache and stomach ache. I'm not even scared for the surgery; I've had 2 C-sections and I'm sure it will be fine. I'm scared for what comes after. For the drastic change this will make in my life. I am scared I will regret it. Any words of comfort are appreciated.
Program costs not billed to insurance,"I'm in the U. S. and currently going through the four months of medically supervised diet my insurance requires before surgery and was wondering if anyone else had their doctors require an additional program or classes not billed to insurance? 

My bariatric center requires a $500 education class that covers preparing for surgery, diet, exercise, planning, nutrition, vitamins, and patient psyche. In addition we get a goodie bag with protein samples, a food measurer, protein bar, journal, breath mints, chap stick, and sample vitamins. 

I'm not complaining about it and have no doubt that these are things key to success but I never see anyone mentioning costs like this so I was just wondering if it was the norm."

Nervous about talking to my doctor about WLS,"Hey everyone. Iâ€™ve been following this sub for awhile just to get an idea of what WLS is all about. 
I have been struggling with my weight for about 3 years. I know thatâ€™s not very long compared to many people but it feels significant to me. I started gaining weight when I first got pregnant and just kept on going. Iâ€™m about 260 lbs at 5â€™8â€ (female). Iâ€™ve been stable at this weight for about a year but I canâ€™t seem to lose weight. I also have sleep apnea and a history of severe depression. 
I want to talk to my doctor about my weight but Iâ€™m very nervous. Iâ€™m embarrassed that I havenâ€™t managed to lose any weight on my own. I feel like a failure. Iâ€™m also worried that my doctor will somehow judge me for being lazy. 
I donâ€™t know if weight loss surgery is right for me but I think I need more professional help of some sort. The bariatric clinic near to me only accepts patients with a referral from their family doctor so I have to go there first. And Iâ€™m just really scared.
How did you bring it up with your doctor? Were your doctors understanding of your struggles to lose weight? I donâ€™t think I can handle getting told to just try harder and keep counting calories or something. 
I have an appointment with my doctor next month and Iâ€™m hoping Iâ€™m brave enough to bring my weight up.
Any advice would be appreciated, thanks."
How challenging is the post op liquid diet?,"I'm not required to do a pre-op liquid diet. I only have to do all liquids one day before surgery which is cake.

But three weeks of only protein shakes, drinks, and broth is scaring me I don't know why!! My surgery is in about month((waiting for the call with the date!)"
"Leaving on a Jet plane...um, wuddoi pack?"," OK Gang, Iâ€™ve got a predicament. Iâ€™m going to be traveling to the UK in a couple of months for a week; coincidentally Iâ€™ll be exactly 1 year post op during this trip. Looking ahead at the weather in Scotland and England itâ€™s predicted to be in the 40â€™s-50â€™s F. with rain/snow. 

Normally this isnâ€™t anything Iâ€™m not used to because I grew up in the Northeastern US and Iâ€™m no stranger to this weather. My issue is that I have no idea how to pack, I now live in the Southern US and I donâ€™t really have a large call for â€œwarmerâ€ clothes and Iâ€™m not done losing weight. In short I donâ€™t want to buy clothes that will be too big for me in a few months and will be useless to a lot of others (due to living in a warm climate and no need for the clothes by other locals) if I donate them. My return on investment will be crap if I buy new and donate them to the thrift stores. Also being in the South, I donâ€™t really have a large selection of used warm clothes at the thrift stores that I could buy on the cheap.

Whatâ€™s a guy to do?

The one solution that seems to be the best in this situation is that I buy some thicker undershirts new, those I donâ€™t care if they are baggy in a few months, and look for some heavier long sleeve shirts at the thrift stores and maybe some used pants there too. 

Any feedback would be very helpful.

Psych Eval Issues,"Hey, so Iâ€™m currently in my bariatric program and have completed three, technically four months of the supervised diet. I have also completed all of the other tests and did the psych eval. I was completely honest but blunt about how my mental health has improved and that Iâ€™ve been seeing a therapist for a year and have worked very hard. The person evaluating my psyche finished everything by saying that she thought I was very insightful and seemed as though I was doing good for myself. She then said she didnâ€™t think theyâ€™d be calling me (as a call from them is bad news.) and then we parted ways. She said if they didnâ€™t call me within two weeks then I was in the clear. Well just yesterday I got a call saying I was not an adequate candidate for the bariatric surgery due to my past mental health issues such as PTSD, self harm, eating disorder, and insomnia. They then required a letter from my therapist telling them that Iâ€™ve basically overcome these issues, but my therapist wonâ€™t write a letter as she says she canâ€™t. So instead theyâ€™re sending my file essentially to them. Iâ€™m extremely upset and feel defeated. There was some things for their reasonings as to why I wasnâ€™t a good candidate such as psychosis which I didnâ€™t even tell the psych evaluator due to the fact I havenâ€™t had those issues since I was about 12-13. Iâ€™m now a 21 year old woman going on 22. All the issues they stated are old issues from when I was about 12-16. How can they say Iâ€™m not a good candidate simply because of my PAST mental issues. If that were the case, then no one would get through the psych evaluation! Iâ€™m so confused and frustrated and I was led to believe everything was fine. Iâ€™ve been losing weight due to the supervised diet and will continue to do it and go to the appointments as I have three left then everything gets sent to the insurance. But if this psych eval prevents me from getting the surgery, Iâ€™m not sure what Iâ€™m going to do. If I can appeal it or what? Anyone have any information or experiences they can share? Also Iâ€™m so sorry for the formatting, Iâ€™m on mobile. My stats right now are 5â€™1, 228.  


** quick edit, itâ€™s been well over two weeks. Itâ€™s been about a month, so this phone call was extremely unexpected."
[AU] Sleeved 1st May,"Hi folks,

&amp;#x200B;

Just thought I'd join the sub...Here's been my experience thus far.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - I was a fat bastard. I've now had surgery and can't go back. Now I'm not so fat, but I'm still trying to deal with where I am with food - or the lack thereof.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background - I'm a 6ft 3 and SOLID build male - 46yrs old this year.

I'd done diets, I'd done lite 'n easy, You Foodz, etc... Tried exercising - but keeping the weight off long term - nothing was really sticking.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of last year, I weighed in at 171.5kg (378lbs). Yeah... 

&amp;#x200B;

So I went and saw my GP and told him I needed to get serious about losing weight.

I was expecting him to say ""Right, get a good dietitian and physical trainer...."".... instead he simply says:

&amp;#x200B;

""Surgery."" He finishes with: ""Or you're dead in 10 years..."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Whoa...

&amp;#x200B;

I was completely taken aback. My own self image was in enough denial that I didn't think I was ""FAT""... certainly not enough to require surgery to fix it. This, however, was enough of a mental slap in the face, that it made me realise ""I shit - I really am a fat bastard!""

&amp;#x200B;

Now - to be fair - being 6ft 3, I was carrying it well enough that people didn't THINK I was as heavy as I was. Not even me. But there I was.

&amp;#x200B;

So I end up seeing my surgeon, who explained to me the three options: Band, Sleeve or Bypass (RYN)

I discussed it with my wife, and opted for the Sleeve.

I get the appointments to see the psychologist and the dietitian. I take my wife with me to the dietitian, just so she can hear from someone else who much I SHOULDN'T be eating!

&amp;#x200B;

2 months before Sleeve Day (SD), immediately after seeing the dietitian, I switched up to eating the following:

* Breakfast: Protein Shake
* Lunch: Roast Veggies (from the zero calorie list - you know, it costs more calories to digest than they give you)
* Dinner: more Roast Veggies and 2.5x Basa Fillets (fish)

This is what the dietitian told me I would only be able to eat 2 WEEKS before the surgery. I figure - may as well get a jump on it EARLY. I didn't tell my wife that I could eat more, just left it at this. I stop having any soft drinks, just carbonated water from the soda stream.

&amp;#x200B;

2 weeks prior to SD, I moved to just having protein shakes for every meal. I'd dropped enough weight that I feel the cold again. I no longer sleep on top of the sheets, but now, under them with a blanket added to the top. I need to wear a jumper when I go outside in 16 degree (c) weather, instead of just wearing short sleeved tops. So...progress

&amp;#x200B;

Finally - I got to SD (Wednesday 1st May). Thanks to the efforts over the last 2 months, I'd already dropped 20kgs (44lbs).

Going in I was somewhat nonchalant, and a bit eager. Fair to say, I'd never had major surgery before, and I had NO idea what I was in for coming out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up in ICU with an AGONISING pain in my abdomen. The primary incision site, where they'd removed the excess stomach was like a hot poker in my side. Apparently they tried putting me on fentanyl for pain management. What no one knew is that apparently I react badly to fentanyl - it represses my respiratory system - so I kept stopping breathing. They moved me to Oxycodone and the pain went away, and I kept breathing. WINNER!

&amp;#x200B;

I was out of ICU the next day and put on the ward. I was doing 'blockies' around the ward when I couldn't sleep to exercise myself. Made the nursing staff happy because they didn't have to push me to do it. I was on IV fluids till Friday afternoon, but I was having issues drinking water. Swallowing was easy - it was the two bits AFTER that, that was painful...

Like the water would go into my throat when I swallowed, then SQUEEZED through into my poor, small abused stomach like it was fired from a tiny super-soaker. Then the same again as it exited the stomach down the bottom. FREAKY.

&amp;#x200B;

Spent the next 3 days on the ward till they decided I was fit to go home. The pain in my abdomen is still bad. At SD+4, I get sent home with pain killers - which I use for 3 days, then just don't. (It's Oxycodone - I did NOT want to rely on it!!)

By this time, I was able to have protein shakes and really really runny soup. This becomes my diet for the next 2 weeks. And I had to eat it SO SLOWLY.

By this point I'd reduced my food portions to just over half a mug of soup....and depending on the thickness of the soup, it took me anywhere from an hour to two hours to finish it.

I was missing solid food SOOOO BADLY!! Textures, and savoury spicy stuff.... even just having one different flavour in my mouth at a time instead of 'the blend' of flavours from blending a pasta mince sauce into 'soup'... I felt like I was jonesing for SOLIDS.

&amp;#x200B;

At SD+20, I'm back at work. Since the operation, I've dropped another 10kgs (22lbs) taking me down to 141kgs. I have a neck again... which is 

&amp;#x200B;

At SD+24, I've starting to have un-blended pasta mince sauces for my meals. I had a hash brown from McDonald's for Breakfast one day - and can only finish half of it before I became 'full'. I started to resign myself to never being able to eat out ever again - or at least - this is how I was feeling...

&amp;#x200B;

I had some rough days where I cracked it simply because I ate too fast, then got MAD indigestion and cramping... and I was HATING this. I know I HAD to do this, but I was still HATING it...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm now at SD+43 and I'm kinda back on solid foods again. I find for solids, I have to take a mouthful of something, then have NOTHING for the next 5-10 minutes, then another  mouthful....If I push this too far, then I get indigestion. If I don't take it slow and LISTEN to my body, it's BAD indigestion and I can end up in the toilet ""reverse shitting"". It's not throwing up, because it's not violent. It's like the muscles in my throat just push everything back out slowly through my throat and my mouth and I spit it into the bowl mouthful by mouthful. Gross....

Soups are easier. I can finish my 'now normal' amount of soup in about 30mins, but I still need to take it slowly or I get indigestion.

I'm completely off anything carbonated, including my soda stream soda water. I simply can't handle the bubbles anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

The positives: As of this morning, my weight is down to 137.4kg.

My snoring has virtually STOPPED. I no longer need to use my CPAP machine to get a good nights sleep.

I can walk and talk without getting out of breath, climb stairs, put on shoes, bend over, all without having difficulties...

I've dropped from a 7XL to a 4-5XL shirt size and now NEED to wear a belt with my pants to keep them up. I'm resisting the offers of my wife to shop for new clothes considering I'm only half way to my goal weight of 110Kg (242lbs), but my wife is STOKED with how I look now.

&amp;#x200B;

Still I find I'm missing EATING... all the flavours, the ability to NOT have to worry about how much or often I'm putting something in my mouth. It's ....I don't want to say depressing because I don't FEEL depressed... but ...yeah... it's still....I'm still having moments when I wish I'd never done this - but there's no going back. They can't undo this.... which is why I chose it. No weak moments will undo this. I can't chicken out. It's DONE. I just have to deal and move on.

  
So anyway - that's me and my deal. Thanks for those who read this far.

Didn't mean to make it this long, but apparently I had more to say than I thought I did!

&amp;#x200B;

A very real look at a 2 day post op belly from a laparoscopic RNY,
Talking with tween kids about wls?," I have considered surgery for many years now, and have been doing my  research for the last year or so.  I (Male 40s) finally pulled the  trigger and have a consult with a surgeon in September.  
One of the  things I wrestle with is how to broach the subject with my tween kids.   They are a bit young to have a frank discussion and too old to sugarcoat  it.  I donâ€™t really care what anyone other than my wife and kids think  of me going through this. This is coming a couple years after a knee  replacement surgery. But that was easier to explain because they  experienced me in pain on an almost daily basis.  I was thinking about  using the experience we had at universal studios where I couldnâ€™t go on  several rides because of my size.  
Any thoughts or experiences that could help me out on this one?"
Anyone on antipsychotics?,"I've been considering weight loss surgery because my BMI is 48. Because it's so high, I believe I would respond better to RnY than gastric sleeve. But I have schizoaffective disorder that has been well controlled with medication for eight years. I worry about changing the way the meds are absorbed. 

Another factor is the fact that a large amount of my weight gain is attributable to my antipsychotic medications. When I started them, my BMI was 30. A year later, it was 48 which I've been able to maintain. My doctor tried taking me off the antipsychotic to help me lose weight. I was hallucinating pretty quickly. 

Anyone on antipsychotics had a sleeve or RnY? Did it affect how you responded to your meds? Did you lose enough weight for it to be worth it? "
Thanks Everyone!,"Had my vsg early morning 5/23/19, and I wanted to thank everyone here for the advice and what to expect. Little things like knowing what to pack for the hospital (Sweatpants, QuaseEase, Chapstick), what I would want at home (recliner chair, heating pad), how I should expect to feel (strong discomfort moreso than pain in the belly, but pain in back and chest from the gas), what to do (sip sip sip, walk walk walk), and that it would get a little better each day. 

Thanks to the people in this forum I knew what to expect and feel like I am really ready to start my new lifestyle with this tool."

Six month follow up with the surgeon and he wants me to dramatically increase my calories,"I'm really struggling with this. At my 3 month follow up they told me to eat 800-1000 calories a day. I was under 800 at that point so I made an effort and bumped it. I stayed at about 850 calories until about a month ago when I went up to 1000. Yesterday I asked my surgeon where I should be now and he casually goes, ""oh like 1500 to 1800""  !!! I said there's no way, I have no idea how to eat that much. And I want to lose another 70 pounds. That just seems nuts. And he says, ""well you need to make a concentrated effort to get above 1200"".  

I tried to do 1200 last night (I work third shift) and have to resort to eating peanut butter off the spoon to make it. This sucks. Any advice for me? Did anyone else mentally struggle with being forced to eat more? I'm sure I easily could with shit like pizza and donuts, but I dont want to do that... And I want to get that last 70 pounds off..."

Pre Op Appointment 4 hours??,I have been through a 6 month supervised program and had all of my pre op testing done. I have a â€œpre opâ€ appointment one week before my surgery. They said to plan on 4 hours. What do they do that takes 4 hours?? I feel like Iâ€™ve already had every test under the sun!
1 year today!,"Hey everyone! Happy April 3rd! 

A year ago today I went through with a VSG. 

This surgery changed and saved my life. 

I started at 360 pounds. This morning I weighed in at 211 pounds! It was the best thing Iâ€™ve ever done. Hands down. 

Before I just laid around and didnâ€™t do anything. Now, I go snowboarding, workout with a personal trainer 3x a week, run, skateboard, and most importantly, play with and show my daughter that there is so much to DO in life. 

I wanted to quick make this post and let ANYONE thinking about this procedure know that it is without a doubt my greatest decision. If youâ€™re on the fence, stop procrastinating, youâ€™re health is far too important to be waiting even one more day. 

I went from a 3XL shirt at 48â€ pants to a L and 36â€ pants. I fit in restaurant booths, airplane seats, theater seats, i can cross my legs, I donâ€™t feel the anxiety I used to feel when knowing I was the largest in the room, I shop for clothes at regular stores again. I had no clue how all of those things effected my life until I was able to do them again. 

Sure, I have extra skin. I could care less about it. I wear compression pants when running or working out to keep it all in place ï¿½ï¿½

Iâ€™m sorry if this post sounds â€œbraggyâ€ i assure you thatâ€™s not my intention; I was just SO on the fence about this surgery that I almost didnâ€™t go through with it, and I donâ€™t want ANYONE to opt out of this surgery due to fear. The life I lived prior to this, was no life at all. 

Have an AMAZING day, yâ€™all. Keep up the good work. "
Post- op caffeine [xpost r/gastricsleeve],"I'm 2.5 months post op and wondering if anyone else has issues with caffeine. I'm not talking anything crazy- a cup of coffee or some ice tea before noon causing awful insomnia. It's currently 2am and I can tell that I'm tired but body feels like I chugged a giant rednull recently.

For reference, I'm on 300mg of extended release Wellbutrin every day but I take that before 8 am so I don't think it's related.

Any ideas?"
Week of July 8th WLS unite here,"I am scheduled for July 10th and was looking for folks who are scheduled the same week to connect here. 

I was originally scheduled for July 1st, but then got rescheduled to the 10th. It was a bummer, but I just decided to continue with the pre-op diet starting June 15th. 

Over the last few days, I have been freaking out on ""whatif"".. what if I do not loose weight post surgery? What if regain a lot after initial loss?.. I know these are temporal and Advent of cold feet. Do people feel the same?"
Regret and depression post-op,"Hi guys, Iâ€™m new to this but I had my surgery a little over two weeks ago. I had the RNY done. It seems as each day goes by, my mental state gets worse. Over the past few weeks Iâ€™ve somehow ended up in a spiral of reading long term effects of the surgery Iâ€™ve gotten. I initially wanted to get the sleeve but at my clinic, the surgeon decides what procedure you get. 

I have struggled with my weight all my life, which was why I decided to move forward with the surgery. Iâ€™m 5â€™3 and my highest weight was about 310 and day of surgery, my weight was at 256. Looking back, Iâ€™m having so many regrets. I donâ€™t know if this was triggered by the obsessive researching into people who end up even worse after surgery. I wake up every morning hoping that I will feel better but the feeling just gets worse. I didnâ€™t have any co-morbidities before surgery. I was just obese and tired of my weight. I did it to reduce my risk of obesity-related illnesses. I was relatively healthy. But now, itâ€™s like I wish I had never done it. 

Iâ€™ve been trying to read happy stories from people who are 10+ years post-op RNY but itâ€™s been a struggle. At 23 years old, I think I may have shortened my life even more by getting the surgery rather than just not having it done. I wish I had read the forums and articles before I went in for surgery.

Edit: thank you all for your replies. Tonight I decided to take myself to Emerg and am awaiting psych evaluation."
I'm no longer losing hair. But...,"..but i had a crown that was thinning before surgery and that became a huge hole between months 3 and 6.

Saw the dietician this morning and feel super overwhelmed with it all. I have numbers and foods and things all buzzing through my head and Iâ€™ve been told I need to eat 5 times a day at present because Iâ€™m not eating enough and it just seems like a full time job to eat and plan meals at the moment!

Out of town friends, co-workers, family...

Are Aldi Fit and Active WL Shakes O.K.?,"Hi everyone! Are the Aldi Fit and Active weightloss shakes (ready to drink kind) acceptable for use pre/post operation?

Just wanted to know if any of you drink them. Iâ€™m waiting on approval from my other medical specialist before having an appointment with the bariatric doctor and wanted to try some protein drinks ahead of time. 

In the past, I didnâ€™t like protein drinks Iâ€™ve tried. I really like the chocolate one from Aldi so far. 

TIA"
Protein shakes are the best,"In the beginning. Now, after four weeks of nothing but protein shakes and four weeks of at least one day, I cannot stand them. I wish companies had better options for flavors and textures. That being said, I am glad they exist. Without them, the recovery process would be so much harder."
How do you guys deal with all the opinions?,"So, letâ€™s start from the beginning. Iâ€™m 31, M, and about 200 pounds overweight. Iâ€™ve struggled with my weight as long as I can remember. The past year or so, Iâ€™ve really let myself go, and now Iâ€™m the heaviest that Iâ€™ve ever been. 

Recently, I went to the doctor for a checkup (which I hadnâ€™t done in almost 10 years) and maxed out the scale there. Not a good feeling. Anyway, my Doc gave me a referral to a bariatric specialist, and I go next week to an informational seminar to see if wls would be a good fit for me. 

Iâ€™m trying get as much education on the subject as possible so I can make a fully informed decision. I like to think of myself as a fairly open individual, so naturally, Iâ€™ve told the people in my circle about it. Which Iâ€™m kind of now regretting. I get that information spreads like wildfire, but now everyone seems to have an unsolicited opinion about it. And I havenâ€™t even gone to the initial appointment yet. My question is, how do you deal with that? At the end of the day, itâ€™s my decision, but it makes it so much more overwhelming when everyone wants to add their 2 cents."

One year anniversary,"http://imgur.com/gallery/I2rx8A0

My one year surgery anniversary was today. I was wearing size 28-32 and now in 16/18. I've had no complications, except my gallbladder being removed, but that was more of a precaution rather than a necessity. Down (only) 125lbs because I stalled out after 8 months. I haven't embraced exercising and I've been eating too much, but I'm aware of these things and am working on adjusting my actions. Sooooooooooooooo... Happy anniversary to me. "
Just had my initial appointment...,"So I have decided to move forward with surgery. The thing is...I had ONLY considered the sleeve. When I went in for my appointment with the surgeon, psych, and nutrition, they all recommended I consider the RNY. 

From those of you whoâ€™ve had it...what do you think?

The vibe I got was I can choose either. But they generally recommend the RNY due to the greater weight loss and and long term results. 

Iâ€™d appreciate any feedback! "
Eating is difficult for me...recipe tips?,"I am one month post-op sleeve and I am kind of lost when it comes to food. Whenever I eat, the food feels heavy on my stomach and I feel sick. 

But maybe I am just eating the wrong foods. Do any of you have nice dish/snack/breakfast/lunch/dinner ideas that worked well for you during this time?"
Buyers remorse? I hope it's just a phase.,"Sitting in my dark hospital room right now as I was sleeved on Monday the 7 and still have some pains. I should be going home tomorrow but I have a hella long ride to do and scared of the bumps in the road. 

I have been getting in my liquids and trying to take small sips but it feels like my baby stomach does not like it and tightens up. That shit hurts! Tell me it will get better! I'm scared I screwed up and I won't be able to get up from bed easily or sleep on my side or other things I could do just last week. 

I know you will all say it's worth it but that's not what I need to hear. How hard was it for you guys and how long can I expect to actually start feeling okay. I will be meeting my Dr tomorrow morning and will ask him all this but nothing beats experience from people who have had the surgery. I also have my period which is screwing with my hormones and feeling hopeless.

Tiny update: Thanks for all the encouragement, it is going much better today mostly because I got to leave the hospital. I am not home yet just because there is a wonderful snowstorm and I am also certain I won't be able to take the ferry tomorrow because of the winds. "
Reducing sugar intake,"Alright #wlsfam, I'm calling on you guys. Something I've been more mindful of lately is my sugar consumption. As a #nurse, sometimes we run on caffeine and sugar. Around 3pm when the stress hits bad, we all usually break down and have some sugar. 

I've not had any concentrated sweets for the past 2 days. When I say that I mean chocolate, cake, soda, candy, along those lines. I do drink sugar free coffee creamer in the morning and eat fruit through out the day. 

I don't really feel any different, like less brain fog or anything like that, but my sleeve does feel better. No weird stomach cramps or pains.

I guess my question is, when avoiding sugar for us, do you just stay away from blatantly sweet things (cookies, soda, candy) or eliminate ALL things with sugar in them (like salad dressings have some sugar in them) as well as sugar free items? Or do you just check the sugar content on labels to make sure it's not overboard?

I'm wanting to continue this sugar reduction in my diet and want to know what you guys have been the most successful with ï¿½ï¿½"

Weird Concern: I don't burp. Anyone gone through WLS with similar issue?,"A lot of people think this is really weird, but I don't burp.   I  have literally never voluntarily burped in my life (at least as far back as I can recall...I'm 38).  I let out an involuntary surprise burp maybe 3-5 times per year, and it's just like a little croak when eating or drinking too fast.  To my recollection, I have never let out a real belch of any sort...ever.  To be clear, I don't live in constant discomfort or anything.  I have never experienced the feeling of ""needing to burp"".   To me, it's like not being able to wiggle my ears.  I can't even really conceive of it.  My gas comes out only one end!

Now, for the most part, this problem(?) has not really had any relevance or impact on my life. But now that I'm 9 days away from VSG (4/8/19), I'm nervous about how not being able to burp will affect my immediate post-op recovery process.  I consistently hear people talk about how critical it is to keep burping to get the air out, and how burping was the only thing that made them feel better.  So where does that leave me!?1?

I know at least some of this is a bit of a myth, as most of the air they pump into your body is in the abdominal cavity rather than literally in your stomach or digestive tract, and the feeling of pressure in the abdominal area is interpreted by your body as needing the burp because abdominal cavity pressure is not something we're accustomed to feeling in normal day to day life.  But that only gives me partial comfort because I've just heard so many stories about how burping is important in this early recovery days.

So, long shot here, but is anyone out there who has gone through WLS burping-challenged like me?  How did you deal with those gas feelings?    (Other thoughts and comments from the burping-able community welcome as well, lol!)"
Too cold after surgery?,"Hey guys, I had the surgery on 24th Nov in 2018. I have lost like 35kg since then and dropped to 85kg which is awesome, but I just feel cold all the time like Im freezing to death. 

When im at home we have a fireplace which heats up the house pretty good, yet im there freezing to death whilst my family is telling me its way too hot.

 Is this normal or is something wrong with me? I like it kinda because I used to sweat like a pig in the winter and now im cold which makes me hate it because I feel like im freezing to death.

I would really appreciate any advice or comments from people who are experiencing the same thing. 

Should I be worried for being too cold all the time?"

Protein shake is so foamy.,"Hey all,

Just started my pre op liquid diet. I'm going with protein shakes mixed with fairlife milk on the recommendation of my dietician but the milk gets so foamy when I use a blender or blender ball. I've tried mixing by hand with a spoon but it never mixes well.

VLS leak fear,"The internet is not helping in figure out how to prevent it or giving my anything on how to avoid it either.

My cousin did the surgery about a month ago and has recently been experiencing symptoms like fever, dizziness, abdominal pain, left shoulder pain as well and he is on his way to getting tested to confirm if he has a leak or now. This situation has freaked me out a bit.

Weight Loss Surgery and IBS-d,"***TL;DR I'm finally considering talking to my doctor about WLS but I'm terrified of how it will affect my bathroom habits. Has anyone else had WLS while having IBS and how did it affect you? ***



I have anxiety induced IBS-d (I'm on meds for anxiety for the last 3 months but my anxiety doesn't seem to be getting better and that makes me more anxious which causes more severe abdominal pain and bathroom issues.) (Think of Adriana from the Sopranos when she started talking to the FBI.) 


Backstory: I am 5'4"". I've struggled with weight since middle school. I've gone up and down constantly. In highschool, my average was between 160-170lbs. Sophomore year of highschool I lost weight and weighed between 130-140, but gained it back by junior year. 

In college I got up to 256lbs freshmen/sophomore years, and then I naturally lost 86 pounds in 8 months with diet and exercise. After college I moved to a new state, quit my job of 8 years, got married and quickly gained back all 86+ lbs between 2015-2016. 

My highest weight was 301 around Thanksgiving 2018. 


So recap, I weighed in at 170lbs on January 18, 2015...and by Nov/Dec 2018 I was 301lbs!!!!!! It's crazy to think about how much weight I gained in a short amount of time. 


I weighed in at 290 on March 6.  I didn't do anything to loose weight from 301 to 290...I think those 11 pounds were just turkey and pie haha.  

I started going to the gym in April and I'm currently fluctuating between 276 and 279 but I'm really struggling to control my appetite. 

I ALWAYS feel hungry, especially after the gym."
Only 200 grams of food at most for a meal?,"Hey guys, I just got sleeved a few days ago, all went well and I'm back home. 

The only thing that's on my mind is the talk I had with the nutritionist in the hospital, she told me I would not be allowed to eat more than 200 grams of food in one sitting for the rest of my life. I should have 3 to 4 meals with each being 200 grams.

This was very weird to hear. Especially because I never heard of a restriction like that.

In no way do I want to gorge myself with tons of food, but 200 grams seems very low, especically with eating just 3-4 meals. What do you guys eat in comparison? Is this common?

My healthy approach to use the sleeve as a tool would have been to eat nutritious and healthy foods until I'm satisfied, without worrying to be in the 200 grams area or restricting the amount of times I eat, as long as it is healthy food. Once I'm satisfied the sleeve will help me stop eating, maybe sometimes at 100 grams of food and other times at 300 grams of food for example. Am I missing something?

I would love to hear how you guys eat and appreciate any input!"
Exhausted 1.5 months post op,"The title pretty much sums it up well. Iâ€™m constantly exhausted and Iâ€™m a little lost with what to do. 

Iâ€™m exercising 3 times a week (I canâ€™t do any more due to my energy levels), trying to hit 2L a day and eating about 800/900 cals a day.

Nexplanon with WLS?,Just curious if anyone had WLS with the Nexplanon implant in their arm.  Do I need to be concerned about it moving when I start to lose weight?  Will it just stay right under the skin as I lose?
Cardio or weights?,"I will just preface this with this statement. I hate cardio. I like going on hikes, but thatâ€™s the extent of my cardio enjoyment.

However, I donâ€™t mind weight lifting. Is doing 90% weights and 10% cardio â€œokâ€ for weight loss after bariatric surgery? 

Or should I just torture myself and make it a 50/50 effort? 

I have about 30-40 pounds of weight to lose (probably more realistically 30-35). 

I havenâ€™t started an exercise program yet and I know itâ€™s time lol. These last 30 will come off slowly but surely with just diet. Exercise will just help it get off a little faster."
Am I crazy?,"So Iâ€™m currently trying to figure out a date to have my VSG and Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m crazy or not lol. Iâ€™m a student and the only time that really works for me to have the surgery would be in February during my spring break. Having surgery then would give me just over 6 weeks before I have to start my practicum (student teaching) and then I have to work during summer break (End of April to end of August). 

Iâ€™ve had 2 different laparoscopic surgeries before and recovered super well &amp; fast from them. My pain tolerance is pretty good too. Iâ€™m also young (23) so I feel like that would be on my side. 

So I guess my question would be am I crazy to give go back to school a week after surgery? Itâ€™s lecture style classes so Iâ€™m only sitting, classes are like 2 hours max with long breaks in between plus I only live 2 minutes away from school. I think Iâ€™ll be fine to do it, but Iâ€™ve also never been through it so I donâ€™t know. Any feedback would be great!! Thanks :)

TLDR: is going back to university a week after VSG too short of time? Or should I be okay?"

Immediately fatigued after nearly every meal,"I'm 3 months post, and for the past few weeks I've been super tired after most meals. It doesn't matter if they are protein heavy or include some carbs, I need a nap. It usually passes in an hour or so, but is really difficult when I'm at work running afternoon meetings. I forgot to mention it during my 3 month checkup a few weeks ago.

Does this happen to anyone else? Anybody know why?"
iâ€™m about a month and 10 days post op and i wake up with almost morning sickness that makes me not want to eat nearly all day. any tips? i lost 7 lbs in one week because i just didnâ€™t want to eat since my stomach was hurting,"but like i said, itâ€™s like a morning-sickness kind of sick"
"Almost 1 month post RNY, reporting current issues","Hey. 4 days until I hit my 1 month mark. Here are the problems I am facing currently. Any tips would be nice as always.

1- Awful taste in mouth which does not go away no matter what I do

2- Terribly tired, but cannot sleep. For the record I had sleep issues pre-op so that's probably not because of the surgery

3- So much gas, ruining my every day

4- Craving everything I see, and my current portions make me feel like I will never be able to eat a whole slice of pizza, or anything of similar size

5- Can't eat chicken soup with pieces in it, anything solid fills me up incredibly fast and liquids DO NOT go along with it

6- Starting to hate diary products because I've had so many

I had dropped about 25 pounds 5 days ago. Did not weigh myself since then."
Diet and extended work travel question.,"Any road warriors out there that travel formwork on an extended basis, like weeks at a time?
If you stay in a hotel for a long time how to you work your meals?

I'm assuming breakfast would be easy because its usually a buffet and eggs an meats are typically a given. But what about lunches and dinners? Eating out has got to cost a fortune."
Breastfeeding post sleeve,"So I am currently breastfeeding a toddler. Iâ€™m 4 days post op for sleeve and she is going to bed now and I decided to lay down and let her feed because she hasnâ€™t since before my operation. 
My dietician said itâ€™s fine to still occasionally breastfeed my toddler post op as long as I try and have some extra fluids. 
Problem is Iâ€™m only JUSTTT meeting my fluid amounts if at all. Im improving daily i managed to sip on water throughout the day plus 1 and a bit optifast shake + half a hydralyte ice block that Iâ€™ll finish once sheâ€™s asleep. 
My question is I guess, how much extra should I be drinking to account for the fluid loss Iâ€™d be doing by breastfeeding once every day or two? 
Keep in mind itâ€™s mostly a routine/comfort thing at her age, she doesnâ€™t rely on it for primary nutrition "
What are you guys eating 4 weeks out?,"Title says it all. I'll be four weeks out tomorrow and sometimes I'm not sure if I'm doing this right. I know I'm supposed to focus on protein first so the vast majority of my solid food intake has been various forms of canned chicken puree. I've also had a pureed Boca burger, and I'll usually have some cottage cheese with genepro added. Should I be adding vegetables to my diet?  Or does that come later?  I'm SUPER constipated so I feel like the fiber will help, but I'm also having benefiber daily so. With being able to eat so little I feel like I don't know what to concentrate on!

A couple of additional questions - how long do you wait between bites when eating?   

And I'm going on a weekend trip at the end of July, I'll be 13 weeks out then. For those in that stage, can you tell me what your typical daily diet looks like?  I'm trying to plan and wondering if I'll need to get groceries or if I'll be able to being what I need. The people I'm going with are mostly going to be eating out or ordering in."

Which procedure did you get done? Why did you choose it? Anyone do or even consider Duodenal?,"I had initially started out looking at VSG but I'm honestly now at the point where I'm thinking DS (Duodenal Switch or the Loop version) might be the best way to go for me. Much more difficult to find a surgeon that performs the procedure in the US, but from what I can tell it has the best long-term success as long as you are compliant.

Did you look at DS or know about it?"
Anyone unable to eat meat?,"Has anyone found that they've been unable meat? The taste and texture make me feel sick. Fish aswell. I'm relying more and more on vegetarian food when I do eat.

100 lbs down!,"I had RNY on 1/24/19 and Iâ€™m happy to report Iâ€™m down 100 lbs from my starting weight.  Started at 466 lbs, my surgery weight was 440 after the 2 week liquid diet and this morning I was 364 lbs.

Iâ€™m so happy to have hit this milestone already, but itâ€™s a little bittersweet just thinking about how far I still have to go.  Overall, Iâ€™m so much happier now though.  I used to have to take a break halfway through mowing my lawn, now I can mow the whole thing without even breaking a sweat.  I love the new me so far, canâ€™t wait to see how I feel after I lose the next 100 lbs!"
I GOT MY DATE!!!,"^(HW: 310   CW 290   GW 150)

So I finally got my date after a little thyroid scare, Sept 16!!! I am so pumped and so scared at the same time! There is just one thing lurking in the background....... FMLA!!! How did everyone get off work? I work for Penske and as some of you may know getting off for so long (2-4 weeks) can be challenging, damn near impossible! Does this surgery even qualify as a medical necessity? Also, when I went to the intro meeting I could have swore the Doc said some people went back to work within 3 days to a week! I didn't expect to be off so long. I was just going to take the rest of my vacation days. Uuuugh there's always one more obstacle to jump through. I am just ready! 

Thanks in advance for the advice!"
Whoops,"So one of my favorite meals is an ounce of goat cheese with a half an ounce of these town house flatbread Italian crackers that are low in fat, but have garlic and stuff so theyâ€™re not at all bland, unlike something like a saltine, which would be the equivalent nutritional value, but anyway there was only an ounce and a quarter of goat cheese left in the package, so I said to myself, â€œWell, it would just be silly to put a quarter ounce of cheese back in the fridge,â€ so I decided to eat all of it with a couple extra crackers. WELL! I got SO sick. I was up hugging a basin until three in the morning, when I finally passed out on the couch. All from an extra quarter ounce of cheese and two extra crackers! (And these crackers are tiny, eight in half an ounce) Believe me, I learned my lesson!"
Vitamin recs (brand and how to stay on a schedule),"I have a date for RNY on Oct 16th, which means now itâ€™s time to start seriously thinking about post-surgery vitamins and supplements.

A stall...so soon? (VSG on 7/30/19),Hi there! I weighed myself and only lost a pound since last Tuesday. I was surprised that I hadnâ€™t lost more. Itâ€™s been 2 weeks since my VGS. Anyone have a stall so early on?

Stomach cramping right after surgery when drinking ?,"Hi I'm having cramping after drinking fluids. I was discharged this morning. I'm 2 days post op. Is this normal or should I call the doctor's office? I'm also having trouble making a bowel movement but I called the doctor's office and they said to add miralax to 12 oz of water so I'm doing that now but I'm also worried about the cramping?

Edit: I think it's gas. My heart rate and temperature is fine. I let a gas x chewable tablet dissolve in my mouth/chewed it 30 times and am taking laps around my apartment. I also sipped a few shot glasses of the miralax +12 oz of water. I'm scared I'm doing too many weird things to my new belly but I'm just praying the gas subsides and I can make a smoother BM when the time comes. The cramping did subside when I went to bed last night, now today I can drink without the cramps.


Edit: Pooped on post op day 6 or 7 days from the surgery. It was big and soft (I sipped Miralax 1x + 12 oz water per day starting on day four)."
Calories at 8 months post-sleeve?,"Hi all! 45 yo female here. I'm in the very slow loser camp. I took it in stride for a while, thinking *at least I won't have as much loose skin to worry about!* But now I'm getting frustrated as my weight tends to go up and down the same three pounds. My surgeon has me on 1200 calories a day and 90 grams of protein. I lift weights for an hour twice a week, walk 45 minutes to an hour every day and also get in at least one HIIT workout (20-30 minutes) each week. Am I eating too much? How many calories were you ladies getting in at 8-10 months post-op? Thanks!"
What is going to make this time any different? (and other scary thoughts),"WLS was designed for those who have exhausted their options, right?

Well what do you do when that scary thought crosses your mind of ""what is going to make this time any different""?

The cost? The severity of surgery? The embarrassment or stigma that I feel for taking it this far?

I WANT the answer to be the will power, but I have had the will power before.

Ive tried what I classify to be everything, which includes....

* Regular Old Calorie Counting
* Atkins/no-carb/low-carb
* Nutrisystem
* Whole-30
* HCG Injections
* Biggest Loser Challenge
* 'The Fast Metabolism' Diet
* 'The 17 Day Diet'
* Phentermine
* And of course, I've done Weight Watchers more times than I can count.

I've lost and gained the same pounds over and over again.

I have always been active and I go to the gym regularly, so I am not worried about that, but in addition to all of the diets, I have had 3 personal trainers in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

I see everyone post about the anxiety they experience when they realize they won't be able to enjoy the same foods they used to, and I get nervous of that as well. I know those foods are what got me here in the first place, but what happens if after awhile my brain and body cant fight as hard as I need them to.

How did you get over similar feelings?

For the record, I am in the early stages, and nothing is set in stone.  I see all of 'NO REGRET' posts and its very inspiring, but of course my head floods with self-deprecating thoughts!

Any notes and advice is appreciated :)"
Wls legs tingling and stiffening,"Hello,

my wife is 4 weeks out from gastric sleeve surgery, she was one of the lucky with little to no pain during the recovery. In the last week she started feeling tingling and stiffening on both legs only when she sits on the toilet bowl. 
Usually, this happens after a minute or two she sat, so this is not due to long sitting sessions. All go back to normal few minutes after she stands up again. The same thing doesn't happen if she just sits on a chair for example or on the couch.

&amp;nbsp;


Anyone experienced similar problems?
What it could be? 

&amp;nbsp;


I saw in past posts people having tingling because of nerve damage, lack or surplus of B12 or just the body re adapting to the weight loss."

Is this not covered by FMLA?,"I am employed by a public municipality. I am eligible for FMLA and have 2+ weeks of paid sick time in my leave bank.

However the documents my HR wants filled out seem invasive to my privacy and indicates they can decide it is â€œnot a qualified conditionâ€

The letter says â€œ...from this document the city can determine if this will be a qualified condition for approved FMLA/OFLAâ€

The document they reference is the part the doctor fills out that says â€œdescribe the medical facts that support your above certificationâ€

The certification being the doctor certifying I need to be off more than 3 days (absence from work plus treatment)

How can the city decide its â€œnot a qualifying condition?â€ I am two weeks away from surgery and they want this paperwork ASAP. Iâ€™m suddenly nervous that not only will I have to tell the the type of surgery Iâ€™m having but also possibly get denied for the leave?"
Infection :(,"So I had VSG on 5/13/19. 

Felt great for the first 2 weeks othan that the swelling and a hematoma around the incision site.

Started running a fever 2 days ago, and my pulse was 120.

Went to my surgeon yesterday and he said he wasnt worried about it and my fever was probably from a cold.

Well my fever got worse so I went to the ER this morning and they did a CT scan and sure enough I have an infection.

Now I am on IV antibiotics and they might have tp do surgery on me to drain the abcess.

Sooo at least it wasnt a staple line leak I guess.


#update: NOT AN INFECTION!  got to my surgeons office and he opened me up and drained out a bunch of serous fluid that had built up in pockets around the wound. He said that build up can cause an inflammatory response which mimmics an infection. But there was no pus or any sign of infection.


Now my wife has to pack my wound for the next week or 2, but I should be okay!!!"
"Surgeon appointment on Monday, what to expect?","I am going through Kaiser in Fresno for my surgery. I have an appt with my surgeon on Monday.

How often do you see the surgeon?,"I was just wonder for others who are going through the process right now, how often do you see the surgeon ? Iâ€™m going through the motions at Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore ,MD and I have only met the surgeon once . In fact I havenâ€™t spoken to anyone from there with the exception of when I call to make sure they got a fax I sent over. Itâ€™s been about 5 months so far since I met the surgeon and I have completed 5 months of doctor checkups and weight management, got an egd, did a sleep study, went to the psychiatrist, met with a nutritionist and as far as I know I just need to go to a group class meet and one more doctor visit with primary before they can submit my information to the insurance.  Just seems odd to me that I met the surgeon for a total of about 15 to 20 minutes before he is going to do a 2 hour long surgery to me . Is this typical ?"

Acanthosis Nigricans (or darkening of the creases) non scale victory!,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share this non scale victory with you.

At my height weight I was about 285 (5 foot 5. Female. Mixed races)  and I noticed for years now that i had acanthosis nigricans. It's a velvety darkening of the creases. Groin. Back of neck, knuckles, knees, cleavage. It's a sign of insulin resistance which made sense since I have PCOS but also right before my surgery in Jan 2019 (mini gastric bypass, similar to roux en y), i got diagnosed as prediabetic. 

So I got my surgery in Jan 2019 like I mentioned and within a month I was off my metformin, I still monitor my blood sugar levels with diet and exercise now but after dropping 45 pounds I noticed my cleavage, hand knuckles and knee discoloration is gone.

The acanthosis nigricans literally disappeared. It was there for at least 10 years and then it just disappeared as my weight came off and my insulin resistance backed off. 

Of course I cannot say this will work for every one else who has this (it's more common in people of color) 

But knowing that it CAN go away hopefully means it CAN go away for those of you here that have it! 

I will include a pic of my cleavage. It's safe for work. It's an extreme close up of the skin between my boobs.

Anyone else experience positive skin changes?

3.5 weeks post op and think I hurt my incision by being too physical at work,"Hey guys. Iâ€™m about three and a half weeks post op and I went back to work a week ago (Iâ€™m the front desk supervisor at a hotel). I had to be more physical today due to how busy we were - major housekeeping work, some lifting, pulling, lots of running around, etc. my main incision is hurting pretty bad tonight for the first time since surgery. Bad enough that I had to take the meds they gave me post op when I got home a few minutes ago. Iâ€™m icing now and off tomorrow so Iâ€™ll take it easy but Iâ€™m a little worried I overdid it way too much? Is there anything else I should do? I have an appointment Tuesday."
Mints post surgery/nausea relief,"Hi guys. I'm pre-op, my surgery is being submitted to insurance TODAY so it should hopefully be soon. 

The one thing I have the most anxiety about is nausea. I have dealt with emetophobia (fear of vomiting) for years and often have low-level nausea due to my anxiety. My relief is to chew peppermint gum. I know I can't chew gum post surgery due to gas, but am I able to have mints?  Or does anyone else have any good suggestions?  I can suck it up and deal with it if I need to but it'd be nice to be comfortable."

Possible to recover from wls failure?,"I had RNY back in 2007. Had fantastic results for 5 years, lost about 60% excess weight. Was doing very well. Got into a very high stress program in school and gained a little, but then was hit with a whombo combo of thyroid disease and mis-diagnosed clinical depression. Metabolism tanked, energy level tanked, and the cherry on top- put on a medication that caused severe weight gain.

I've been steuggling ever since. This year I hit my pre surgery weight and I don't know what to do. No where in town does the revisional surgery for RNY. I have no support system as the program that did the surgery no longer exists.

Anyone at all run into this? How do I recover?"

I cant recommend selling stuff on EBay enough,"I'm trying any way I can to save money on all the clothes I'm having to buy and selling too big stuff is really helping. All along I knew I would be able to sell my jeans, t-shirts and bras but I've really gotten creative and I'm surprised at what sells. There's actually a market for camisoles, shoes, cheap leggings I got at Wal-Mart, my too big scrubs, too big lingerie... I've even started selling kitchen stuff I no longer need, like my big rice cooker, the five billion blender bottles I thought I would need for protein shakes but dont use, even this little timed food safe I bought in a futile attempt back when I was binging so I wouldn't eat so much candy. That one sold in two hours!    

Since surgery I've profited about $150, pure profit with fees and everything taken out. I've even bought clothes on eBay, worn them for a few weeks, sized out and turned around and sold them again. I really recommend giving it a shot, it makes the sting of replacing all your clothes a lot easier to deal with."

"Take another little piece of my [digestive system] now, baby!","I got a call from my primary on Saturday (that's how you know it's good news) with the results of my recent gallbladder ultrasound.  Full of stones and the wall is thickening.  So I'm scheduled for an appointment with my WLS surgeon on Friday to get on the surgery calendar.

&amp;nbsp;

I've read all about gallbladder issues on this sub and have searched through old posts, which have been really helpful.  **What were your recoveries like as far as returning back to your ""normal"" level of physical activity?**  I have a 13 month old and chasing him around post-WLS was a challenge for a couple weeks.  I'm hoping the recovery this time around will only take a few days.  I also LOVE to golf and go out 3-4 times/week during the summer.

&amp;nbsp;

A little background:  I am 2 months post-WLS today.  I had RNY on 5/1/19; HW 234 - SW 204 - CW 174.  About 3 weeks after surgery, I started notice that my stool (few and far between as they were) looked very ""clay like"".  I knew that was a hallmark symptom of gallbladder issues, but I chalked it up to having a whole new digestive system as I didn't have any other symptoms.  I called my surgeon's office anyway at around 5 weeks post-op and they said if I wasn't experiencing any other issues and didn't mind waiting til the following week, to bring it up at my scheduled 6 week appointment.  So I brought it up at my 6 week post-op and they asked about fatty meals, etc.  But the thing is, I don't eat fatty meals because I don't have room for anything after protein!  The only symptom still seemed to be the stool color and an occasional dull ache under my right ribs.  They said to do the standard gallbladder workup through my PCP and have it referred back over if anything came of it.  So I had an ultrasound on 6/26 and here we are... I've never had a gallbladder attack, as far as I know - and from what I've heard or read, I'd definitely know!  I'm guessing that has a lot to do with my zero fatty foods diet right now, since I only usually have enough room for protein and a few veggies (on a good day).  The aching pain has seemed to increase in frequency/intensity in the last week or so, but it is still plenty tolerable.  Fingers crossed that it doesn't escalate rapidly prior to surgery!"

How long does it take to drink a 230 ml bottle of juice ?,"Itâ€™s been 3 days since Iâ€™ve been sleeved , and I keep taking small sips of whatever clear liquid I have in hand .

Altitude NSV,"For the last 12 years, when I had to be somewhere above 4000â€™, I run out of breath easily. The higher, the worse. Above 6000â€™ feet on vacation in New Mexico, I could barely breath. Taking a shower was like working out for an hour. 
Yesterday I spent the night in Flagstaff, AZ. Over 6000â€™ elevation. No difference to 100â€™. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. I was shocked. 100 lbs lighter and not out of breath once. Even hiked through the forest. Went up and down hills. 

OH and one more thing. Since I moved from Georgia to LA, I miss the Waffle House. I visited one in Phoenix, AZ. And for the first time in my life I fit into their booth. Those are the smallest booths. Canâ€™t really eat their food anymore. Had only a tiny bit of hash browns and 2 eggs. But Hey! I fit into the booth. So psyched."
Is this real life?,"I've been lurking on this sub for the past few months as I prepared for my gastric bypass surgery, which was supposed to happen today. So I feel like you all will truly understand how devastated I am right now. 

I got to the hospital at 11:30 this morning and they took me and my family to the surgical waiting room and told us that they were behind with the surgeries scheduled that day so we had to wait until I could be taken back. 

An hour later, a hospital representative came up to me and my family and told us that there were issues with instrument sterilization at the hospital and they were trying to figure that out while bringing in instruments from other hospitals... So that is why there was a delay, here's a $10 gift card, keep waiting. 

Another half hour goes by and my surgeon takes us into a consultation room to tell us that the instruments they brought in might not be the right size for me but he was still considering whether or not it was safe to do the surgery... So keep waiting. 

Finally at 2:30, he comes back and tells me the surgery is cancelled. It's not safe and he doesn't want to risk it. I 100% agree with his decision... But this is such a punch to the gut. 

I got home and didn't even want to eat anything. I've been in the liquid diet and should be starving by all accounts but emotionally... I was ready for this. I didn't think I'd be eating solid food for weeks. It feels wrong to do so now. 

My surgery is now scheduled for July 19th. Another whole month of the nervous anticipation, the mentally preparing. I feel like you all might understand how I'm feeling right now more than anyone else, and needed to vent. Thanks for reading all of this!"

What did you guys do pre-op if you needed food in a hurry?,"I am new posting here, but have been lurking since my journey started in June, I started at 446  am still going through the pre-op process, and am down to 410 (so close to turning that 4 to a 3)  I still have pulmonary and cardiac testing and meeting with the surgeon this week...any way I had a slip on Saturday (after 3 months of can eating) because I slept through an alarm and woke up 3 hours late...left the house with out eating, and needed to eat something...it wasnt a terrible slip, and I still hit under Calorie and carb allotment, along with hitting my nutritional goals for the day but it feels bad, so I am curious if there are any foods any one keeps on hand or in the car in-case a ""I forgot to eat"" or a ""I have to go right now""...because I know that even though this was a minor slip, and where I am at in the process right now this was alright, I also know once I hit the liquid phase, and the first few months after surgery this could potentially have been a huge risk, so Id just like to be prepared if it ever comes up again.

Trying to get the last bit of weight off to get to my goal weight.,"I am SO FRUSTRATED right now. Long story short, surgery was scheduled, it didn't happen. So the past few weeks I have been trying to drop 2 lbs!! That's it! just 2. and they have not come off. I am fluctuating from day to day anywear from 224(goal weight) to 228, from one day to the next and I am so fucking frustrated I have no idea what to do. I weighted in at 224.4, 224 was my goal weight, I thought, ok, cool. I'll go in Saturday and get weighed in at my goal weight and it will be fine. Saturday rolls around and I weiged 228. What the fuck? And now every day it jumps all over the place. I honestly don't know what the fuck to do at this point. This goal weight is making me feel inadequate, and like this will never happen. I tried doing a liquid diet to drop the weight, and that worked, sort of. I was still on liquids and the scale jumped 4 lbs. Idk any more. I am just so stressed out."
Paying in full before surgery date?,"Hi everyone,

Just wondering what your experiences are with paying for surgery. In my particular case, I have insurance that will cover half and am anxious about having to pay my share of the cost, especially since my program could require I be paid in full before they'll do the surgery.
I've received conflicting information about this. One one hand, how would it be possible for them to make me pay in full when they will not know the full extent of what I will be charged for until the surgery is done?

What was your experience? Were you required to pay a portion before they went through with it, or were you billed after the procedure? "
Documentation of non Surgical methods of weight loss.,"Hi everyone! First time poster and I'm going through the process of trying to get insurance approval. Currently hit a wall with providing documentation of prior attempts at weight loss. 

I cant seem to wrap my head around what exactly they want for that. I've done personal training but when it comes to medical doctors it usually results in them recommending me to lose weight through normal means. 

Is there something I'm missing?"
Finally under 300lbs!,Weighed 299 this morning!  I just wanted to brag about it in a place where people understand!  This was a huge milestone for me!  135lbs gone so far. (73lbs since surgery)
Anyone else not required to lose weight before surgery?,"Hey all! 
This might seem odd but I wasnâ€™t told I had to lose weight or maintain or whatever to be approved by my insurance. The facility Iâ€™m going through is very reputable and well respected in my city and theyâ€™ve worked with my insurance company many times. I also have my case manager thatâ€™s been checking in with me from time to time from UHC and thereâ€™s no requirement there. Thereâ€™s a tracking of food and suggestions on what I should start doing now to make my life easier post surgery? Iâ€™m required to do a six month visit thing where they educate me and I show them my logs of what I eat but thatâ€™s about it. 

Thereâ€™s also no pre-op diet I was told, so no liquid diet or anything crazy. 

Just wondering if anyone else has had this experience? I keep reading everyoneâ€™s posts about losing 10-50lbs BEFORE surgery and Iâ€™m like D; maybe I should be doing something."
Struggling with dehydration.,"This is kind of a two part question.  

I'm three months out from vsg and I'm pretty sure I'm constantly dehydrated. I'm getting at least 50 oz of liquids a day and can't seem to get any more than that. I feel like I'm constantly drinking as it is, and I feel like I'm struggling taking breaks from drinking to eat. My symptoms are constant dry mouth (like SUPER dry), always thirsty, getting really dizzy and almost faint upon standing, headaches, and muscle pain and weakness. Does it sound like I'm dehydrated?

Second question: any tips to rehydrate?  Are electrolyte beverages better for this than plain water?  If so, any options besides G2 or propel as the fake sweet taste makes me sick. 

Thanks so much."

Loose skin post weight loss goal,"Some of you have been following my weight loss over the past two years. I am nearing the end of my weight loss goals. Originally I wanted to get to 250, then 200 and now I set the goal to 190. From looking at other people who have had skin removal surgery and the weight of their skin, my loose skin is probably about 20-30lbs. I have loose skin, everywhere! Neck, arms, thighs, calves, stomach, chest, back, and butt area. I did finally meet up with my PCP who recommended a few plastic surgeons that would be able to look at my skin and fight for insurance approval.

One of my problems with loose skin is my water retention. If I eat anything really salty I will gain a few pounds the next day. To give an idea over Easter I gained 10 lbs, yet I was under my calorie goal for the day. When I travel (fly), I typically gain 20-30 lbs of water weight. Those of you with loose skin, how do you combat this? I drink over a gallon of water a day but its really annoying to have my weight fluctuate that much.

I have a few areas that sweat is pooling and it does cause me to get rubbed raw and hurt. Currently I have to sleep on my side because where my butt crack starts all my sweat pools there and its gotten rather raw and it hurts to lay on my back. At the gym I run on the treadmill but the loose skin on my chest gets painful from all the running, I do wear compression shirts and pants but I don't think they were designed to hold back that much loose skin.

How many of you have had skin removal surgery? and do you regret it? Honestly the surgery scares me because its not exactly getting my tonsils out and its a serious surgery...but I feel like if I don't get the skin removed I am going to develop more and more issues with the skin.

I originally posted this in /r/loseit and it was suggested I post here are this group may be more familiar with skin removal surgery."

General question,"I'm sitting on the couch making a pros and cons list. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. I thought at first the pro list would be way larger but they're about the same size. I then realized almost all of the items on my con list are possibly not going to happen at all or will only be temporary. To help me better put things in perspective, I'm looking to hear from people that are around 6 months or more post op to let me know if most or all of their issues have gone away, become manageable, etc. My con / ""I'm afraid of..."" List is as follows: anesthesia (never had surgery before), dehydration (my type of work = lot of running around in a hot environment), not knowing how many weeks I'll have to take off work, development of GERD, dumping syndrome, hair loss, weak teeth, bad breath, chronic fatigue

Any thoughts or feedback is appreciated. I also recognize I have anxiety. Whenever I have to think about an important/permanent decision I over analyze, get more anxious, over analyze more and before I know it I'm deep in the whole. Sometimes hearing different perspectives can be beneficial."

"""Prescribing"" Doctor for WLS?","So I'm contemplating WLS but the only Dr I really have is my Endocrinologist. 

Would she be able to ""prescribe""/order WLS for me, or would I need to actually see a PCP? 

I ""switched"" PCPs when I aged out of my Pediatrics office, but I only saw a Dr there once and wasn't a fan. Then I went away to school, and had somewhat of a PCP there. But now I'm back and looking for a new PCP, and all three of the ones I'm considering are booking new patients around Christmas. None of the centers near me will go past an initial consult without some kind of order/referral and I'd rather not wait another 6 months.

How Much Walking Did You Actually Do During the First Week Post-op?,"So as someone with a very prevalent â€œtoo-much geneâ€ I have a tendency to have unrealistic goals for how much walking to aim for after surgery. I am currently only 4 days post op and so far can do about 6 laps around my hospital wing. Just looking for others to chime in on what felt like a realistic metric for walking, whether thatâ€™s in steps or miles, etc. I feel like I could be doing more,but I also could see myself overdoing it."
What do you think of my 2 months post op diet ?," Breakfast : 1 slice of brown toast , 1 slice of turkey , and 4 cherry tomatoes . 
Snack : I donâ€™t usually snack , but sometimes I would have a small nectarine .
Lunch : 25 grams of protein ( red meat / chicken / Fish ) along with 1/2 a cup of veggies .
Dinner : Low fat Greek yogurt OR low fat Laban ( Itâ€™s basically buttermilk * or a similar variation to it * thatâ€™s really popular where Iâ€™m from , and it aids greatly in digestion ) .

This NSV makes no sense to me. ??,"I noticed something for a few weeks now. Carrying things is not an issue anymore.

Or when I have to lift a couch or a chair, I can grab and hold on to it so much easier than before where I always had an issue with this stuff slipping out of my fingers.

&amp;#x200B;

I was losing 20+ pounds a month for the 3 months prior to surgery.  Now Iâ€™m losing nothing.

Iâ€™m sad.  Not only am I not losing weight but Iâ€™ve lost the ability to regulate my food intake.  Previously, Iâ€™d cycle through calorie deficits amounts to make sure I didnâ€™t feel deprived, but still lost weight.  Now thatâ€™s not possible.  

I am craving salad and veggies and green things, but my stomach isnâ€™t ready for it.

How much time should I take off work?,"Ok this has probably been posted about a thousand times, but I need advice on how much time to take off work.  I was only going to take a week, because that's all the PTO I have currently, and then ""work from home"" the second week if I wasn't up to going in.  I didn't think I could use STD because I can't afford to take home 60% of my salary, BUT I just looked up the policy and it changed this year to allow 100% pay for 6 weeks!  (There is a one week elimination period where I'd have to use the week of PTO anyway.)  So I could take several weeks and not worry about income.  But now I worry about my boss; I don't know he will respond if I adjust my request to 2 or 3 weeks off.  He's usually flexible and cool with these things, but I have heard of a few cases where he gets shitty with people that have ticked him off.

Insurance problem! Private rooms?,"Hi everyone, new to the forum, I'm getting VSG on February 26th.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been fielding all the calls about where to be and when, and the patient testing coordinator at the hospital said I'd be put up in a private room, because that's ""where the surgeon puts his patients and all they have in that area is private rooms."" But my insurance doesn't cover private rooms (with some exceptions).   


I've called everyone I can think to call, and all they do is parrot the material I've already read. So, how do I advocate for myself to either A. get placed in a semi-private that insurance will reimburse, or B. at least see how much this special room is going to end up costing me?

&amp;#x200B;

Hospital is DMC Harper in Detroit, insurance is Blue Cross Blue Shield Federal, if that helps. But I'd love to hear from anyone who had a nasty surprise on their bill after their hospital stay."
What are you eating?,"Good morning! I'm just curious what everyone is eating. Have you found you like something you didn't think about before? Is there something you loved but can't look at now? Mine would be eggs. I thought I could live on eggs but since surgery just looking at them kills any thoughts of eating. What is your food day like? I just think it would be nice to share what's working for everyone. 

Thanks.

Never gets old,"I trimmed my toenails just now. I didnâ€™t have to contort myself to reach them, I could breathe the whole time, I could see what I was doing. Sometimes itâ€™s the little things that remind you how much things have changed post-op!"
"Insanely tired. All day, every day.","I am almost 2 months post-op and I am getting back to work soon. I am not sure how to do it though.

I am exhausted. The smallest amount of movement like walking to the pharmacy or walking up the stairs makes me so tired I have to lay down and sleep.

I had the same problem before my surgery but I thought that was because I ate crap all day and was morbidly obese. I had hoped to get my energy back after the surgery.

How can I get it back?"
My dietician really advised me against getting bariatric surgery today despite me having a BMI of 44 and having type 2 diabetes for around 4 years,"I visited the dietician for the first time today and basically she highly discouraged me pursuing bariatric surgery. Though i'm morbidly obese and i've type 2 diabetes which is a health issue related to the morbid obesity. (I'm 5'11 and 314lbs)

At first she went on about how people who've had bariatric surgery need to cook special meals, that they can't have full meals and that was her main reason then for saying I shouldn't get bariatric surgery. Then later on I enquired once more and she said about how the waiting list is very long, how i'd have to pay 10 thousand euro to get it done privately and how she's only met 2 people in the past who have had it done.

But I definitely want to go for it. I've been this weight for the past 12 years, since i've been 20. My feet hurt at times when I walk due to the diabetes and I was in ICU for almost a month at the start of last year due to me having severe pneumonia. The staff in the hospital said diabetes played a big part in me getting it.

The main reason I want to get bariatric surgery is to lose all the excess weight and get down to 190-200lbs so my type 2 diabetes won't affect me as much. That my feet won't hurt anymore when I walk, that i'll have them in 15 years time. Or I won't get severe pneumonia anymore during the winter time. I won't let the dietician put me off."

How far out are you and whatâ€™s your restriction?,"Hi everyone!

Iâ€™m just curious how much youâ€™re able to eat! I feel like I have a â€œtightâ€ restriction still.

Iâ€™m almost 5 months out with VSG and can only eat 2-2.5 oz of solids (lunch meat, chicken, cheese...) before Iâ€™m full."
Ever been told by your surgeon that youâ€™re â€œbehindâ€ on your weight loss?,"Sleeved 01/02 this year. Had my 3 month f/u today. Iâ€™m down 38 pounds; that puts me at 237 at 5â€6.5â€™. 

My surgeon wasnâ€™t impressed, had me schedule another dietician visit next month and told me he wants me at 200 at my 6 month f/u, which is Jul 2.

So far Iâ€™ve lost over 10 pounds a month, and this is dealing with having stupid long periods and the stress of a full time job, schoolwork and an internship while preparing to graduate college in May. I thought I was doing â€œokayâ€, and that once things settle things would improve.

Iâ€™ve always read sleeve patients lose slower than bypass patients, but am I really behind...?

Now Iâ€™m stressed about this, and dreading my next month appointment. Iâ€™m expected to keep a food journal too. I mean, Iâ€™m prepared to buckle down of course, but Iâ€™m just...really mad at myself for already failing and being unaware. "

I had ZERO idea I would still have this kind of issue :p

Best Apps for Calorie/Protein/Water Tracking,"I have my fitness pal, but I was wondering if there was a better option.

Thank you so much!! Surgery date 7/5/19."
I have gained.... Guess the honeymoon is over for me. :-(,"OK.... Back on track....

I do not have a depression or a major life change or anything. I just stopped tracking and stopped stepping on the scale and stopped working out (the little I did) cause I have temporarily moved to a place where it is constantly 114 degrees outside and you just cant... It hits you in the face when you step outside. 

I stepped on the scale today... I felt my belt tighter than it should feel and I have gained 6 pounds. My fault.... No excuses! I get back to tracking and I will got into the heat and walk again. 

This threw me back 2 month. Maybe I just retained some water but.... Hell!!  

Learn from me.... keep tracking... I doubt I had more than 1200 calories per day. But without tracking.... ??

Not Losing Weight?,"Hi!  


For the past week, i've gained 4 lbs, note that i'm only 22 days out of surgery.   


What could be causing this?   


I eat less than 200-500 calories a day, it's not because i want to, it's because i can't keep food down and can't eat certain foods.   


I'm in the puree stage and i can't seem to keep anything down, i immediately throw up after 2-3 bites. So i've stuck with doing an extra week or two of liquids. I eat sugarfree icecream (the Popsicles) and Applesauce.   


How's it possible to be 22 days out, and gain 4 lbs while consistently being under 500 calories a day?  


What could be causing this? Every day i get on the scale and see i've gained a pound and get insanely depressed, and end up wanting to eat something because i'm an emotional eater, i end up eating a bite or two of something and just throwing up.   


I tried a ton of different pureed foods and can't keep it down.   


ATM The only thing that's not healthy about me is my water intake. Any idea what may be causing this? And walking, i haven't been walking much at all lately. I don't understand how my body can gain 4LBS in a wk, when i haven't eaten that much, like where is this mass coming from, ontop of this, i'm using bathroom normally, I'm maintaining a huge caloric deficit. Any insight to why this is occurring would be nice."
1 year out and I get married tomorrow!,"A year ago (well before the liquid diet) I was 220 and a size 18/20. I have followed the diet, eat Think Thin protein bars/oatmeal daily, Protein2o water, meat, veggies and cheese. Sometimes I eat fruit and I do eat baked bread from my bread machine with almond flour.

I met my fiance when I was a few weeks out from surgery still 195 lbs. Now I am 126 lbs and a size 2. I zipped a size 2 wedding dress but I do need a size 4 if there is an internally corset. This surgery is life changing. I have energy again and it doesn't hurt to move. Unfortunately I still have arthritis in my neck from being overweight. 

If you are thinking about the surgery, take the plunge. My life is so much better now! I can chase my son, walk my dog, climb stairs, skip rope, zumba classes, and walk down the aisle without losing my breath. 

With all that said, I do have lasting effects. I can't eat rice or noodles. Some fruit give me heart burn. If I eat too fast or without having hot liquids in between meals, I get sick. My hair is still growing in from thinning out after surgery. However, my bloodwork is great! Loose skin sucks but bicycle short spanx like undergarments fix that just fine!"

Stalling / weight gain?,"Hey guys! Quick question regarding the stalls 

Iâ€™m week 5 post OP - 

Iâ€™ve not been eating anything to result in a 800g weight gain (salmon, meal replacement shakes, veg/mince beef), nor increased eating (been sticking to same portions last week and this week) this week however my fluids have increased significantly and finding my self able to drink nearly 2L a day (so so so happy I can satisfy my thirst) 
Also been walking daily 5km on top of my normal activity - to close the activity rings


When stalling with weight etc does it gain as well or just stay? should I be going to my doctor and wondering why the huge increase of weight from the past couple of days? (Iâ€™m back to the weight I was at 8 days ago) 

Itâ€™s disheartening with this gain from only 2-3 days

PCOS &amp; getting approved for VSG,Hi! Iâ€™ve recently been researching my options for weight loss surgery. I have PCOS and have read about VSG helping other girls in my situation. I have been trying to lose weight for 15 years now with no success. My insurance policy does not cover weight loss surgery unless deemed medically necessary by a doctor. They said I could have a doctor send in a pre-determination letter to try to get approved. Would I just need to see a primary care doctor? They said if I still do not get approved I can appeal my benefits with the help of a doctor. Does anyone have any experience with this? Iâ€™m lost and really donâ€™t know where to start.

7 weeks postop and canâ€™t stop bleeding???,"Possible TMI warning

So tomorrow Iâ€™ll be 7 weeks postop VSG. Everything went smoothly and Iâ€™ve had zero complications. 

The only thing is, Iâ€™ve had 4 periods since surgery and Iâ€™m gonna lose my damn mind! I had to stop my birth control 1 month before surgery and I wasnâ€™t allowed to go back on it until 1 month postop, so I thought that would help regulate my periods again but NOPE. 

I had surgery on 2/25 and Iâ€™ve bled:
2/27 - 3/6
3/15 - 3/23
3/29 - 4/8
4/12 - ???

Itâ€™s also been super heavy and painful. 

Has anyone else experienced this?"
What should you ask at your first WLS consultation/appointment?,"I have my first meeting with the surgeon and the rest of the WLS team (nutritionist, psychologist, patient coordinator) on Tuesday! Needless to say, I am SUPER excited!

â€¢ What questions do you think someone should always ask at their first appointment?

â€¢ What red flags should a newbie look for? 

â€¢ What do you wish someone told you from the beginning, or that you had talked about with your team more?

I was going over the latest updates and felt like it may be interesting to share. I have added text boxes to show milestones which I feel were significant.

I'm glad I finally got insurance approval. I'm not sure emotionally I would've been in a place to handle it earlier but I'm pretty sure I couldn't have waited much longer.

I hope this is useful to somebody considering the surgery.

I kinda remember bingeing wistfully but I figured I had 58 years of it and really don't miss it. I just need to stay focused with the scale and my log and staying at six ounces.

FWIW I would've happily stayed the course with the weight-loss clinic but those results were primarily the result of Methylphenidate and my blood pressure was going through the roof so I had to stop taking it.

The sudden drop in 2016 was the result of out-of-control blood sugar. I started taking Toujeo long-acting insulin shots and got it under control and the weight returned.

As of last week my morning blood sugar readings were under 90 w/o any Toujeo at all (after gradually stepping it down) and my Dr. agreed that I no longer need to take it as long as I maintain progress. He was very happy. He said I should be his first appointment every day so that his day could start out as happy as that day's did (I was first at 7 am).

Like I said, I hope this is useful.

Bulimia after gastric sleeve,"I got my gastric sleeve in 2015. I lost 60kg (130lbs) in 5 months.   

The first month I never trained myself to control myselfâ€‹, I didn't listen to my body, I would only know I was full when I was iminentley going to vomit.    

Eventually I realized just how small my peons needed to be, and generally I went well.  

I went through a period of stress and started eating high calorie foods. I would over eat in a small amount of time and feel like I needed to vomit. Of course after I made myself vomit I was still in emotional distress and would eat more.  

This has carried on for 4 years, I've kept the weight off, but the bulimia comes and goes, I hate it, I want to stop eating my feelings, I need better coping mechanisms"

I go in for my first orientation consult tomorrow. I've started a blog to document the whole process.,"I've been a lurker on this sub for a while now. I've been on a wait list for over 2 years for WLS and I finally have my first meeting with my WLS surgery team tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

I've decided to document my story with a blog/website. You can check it out [HERE](http://tonybookless.com/).

Will they reschedule my surgery if I'm sick?,"Hi guys. My surgery is scheduled for the 13th, a week from today. I woke up Saturday with a scratchy throat and it developed into a little big of a cough. Last night the coughing and tickly throat kept me up a bit, but I never felt like I had to take meds. I'm definitely coughing some crap up though. 

I'm kind of freaking out. I've been waiting almost a year for this date and now that I'm a week out I've got something going on. Does what I have sound bad enough to cancel my surgery?  I really don't want to do that but I also don't know if there's a risk of going under with crap in my lungs. Ughhhh..."

Blender Recommendations,"If you purchased a blender for your WLS, which one do you recommend or not recommended? Iâ€™m looking at Ningâ€™s system. Thx!

Pre-op diet starts on Monday! So happy! (And a little nervous, to be honest!)"
Feeling like garbage on the pre-op diet,"Did anyone else feel like garbage of the liver reduction diet?  I'm on day four and actually not having too much of a hard time being hungry anymore BUT I'm so weak, shaky and tired!  I can't focus at work. I am soooooo crabby and keep snapping at my husband and kids. 

Tell me this doesn't continue after the surgery. Does your body get used to having so little calories?"
Is WLS possible at normal weight to help prevent regain?,"I have no issues losing weight. I have lost 50 lbs, regained 80, lost 80, regained 130, lost 130, regained 200. The longest maintenance I had was 3-4 years after losing the 130. Every month it got progressively harder. I obviously ate enough because I didn't lose and slowly gained half a pound or so a month (I also started lifting so newbie gains may have contributed). But I kept getting hungrier and hungrier, despite having lots of protein, no junk food, low carb, plenty of high volume veggies and eating twice as much as I did when in losing stage. It wasn't just mental cravings for junk food either, I wanted to eat anything - raw broccoli, grass and my own arm seemed just as appealing as a snickers bar. It felt like I was starving 24/7 and it was unbearable, it started to affect my mental health because I was in a constant distress and I just couldn't take it anymore and consciously decided to go back to overeating just to make it stop. 

I'm in the process of losing the weight again and it's not too bad yet, but I know when I get to normal weight and try to maintain long term I will end up in the same situation. So I'm wondering if I start encountering the same extreme symptoms would it then be possible to get WLS to give me another 1-2 years of life at a healthy weight? I don't want to get it now because then I'd waste the ""easy"" post-op time on the weight loss phase which is already easy enough, and by the time I reach maintenance it will start wearing off and not give as much benefit. 

I've sought medical help and they are clueless and just talk about forming habits and eating whole, filling foods, but I feel like they don't understand the magnitude of this. The closest I've gotten to helpful advice is that I must have severe leptin resistance that is made worse by the loss of fat (which produces leptin). WLS has shown to positively affect leptin sensitivity, ghrelin and other hormones that contribute to appetite regulation. I know I'm grasping at the straws, but I just don't know what to do."
Exercise,"Hey all! Before I get into this, I am a little over 5 months post op, surgery was July 30th, and I have lost 81 pounds. 

So I have been exercising quite often, I went from 3x a week (lifting MWF) to 5x a week (lifting MWF&amp;running T-TH) and now, as of starting this week, I did 6x lifted MWF and ran T-TH-Sat

My husband doesnâ€™t think itâ€™s a good idea because of how much I eat, which is 800-just under 1000. But I wanted to know what some of you do? My issue is I donâ€™t want to lift any less than 3X a week and as far as cardio, I use the couch to 5k app which has you run 3x.

I wasnâ€™t really tired and I have felt pretty good, but just not sure what the â€œrightâ€ way to go about food and exercise is? 

My food stats this week have been 80oz water, 80+g of protein, 30-40g carbs, 850-980 calories. 

What do you do? What do you suggest?

Body hair after rapid weight loss?,"Can we talk about this? Has anyone else had this happen to them? 37/F here and I'm almost 3 years post RNY. I have lost a lot more than I expected to and now I'm under goal weight. I'm trying my best to get back up there. In the meantime, my body hair is growing like crazy. I have to shave twice a day. It was never like this before surgery. Anyone else have this strange symptom?"
"I get why its important to take least 30 minutes rest between eating, but why between liquids?","I'm struggling with meeting 64oz liquids a day and I find one way that helps is by taking three hours straight of drinking a 20oz of water. During these three hours I don't eat, but I don't drink for 30 mins, rest for 30 mins either, I just drink drink drink for three hours.

Is this potentially harmful for my pouch? Could this stretch it out? Why exactly do I need to take a break between liquids anyway? I thought it digests much faster than food."
Consultation confusion.,"So I've been lurking for a while now and I'm finally making my first post. I had a consultation with my surgeon last month and we talked about RNY and Vsg and which one would fit better for me.

Since I have heartburn really bad now I was leaning towards RNY.

After talking to the doctor he was very clear that he thinks Vsg is going to be best and my heartburn will go away as I lose weight. I've always heard it was quite the opposite and now I'm just...confused. Has anyone ever had heartburn get better after Vsg?

Sorry if this is terrible and hard to read, and thank in advance to anyone that can offer any help. "
Stall post-op VSG. Help!,Iâ€™m 33 days post-op &amp; Iâ€™ve been stalled since day 14. Iâ€™ve been bouncing around the same 3-4 lb range. I keep my protein and my water up but nothing has helped. Iâ€™ve even started introduced moving more and subtle workouts/squats. I donâ€™t know what to do. This is really disheartening. Any tips?
Daily protein levels,"I had RNY on 1/24.  My nutritionist wanted me at 70gâ€™s of protein daily, she told me I would start to lose muscle mass if I donâ€™t consistently hit at least that.  She told me if I get in a little more, thatâ€™s even better, but never put a limit on what is too much protein.

Fast forward about 6 weeks, I feel like Iâ€™m definitely losing muscle mass (for reference, Iâ€™m 32/M, CW 372 lbs).  My bariatric team is almost a 2 hour drive for me so we always schedule my surgeon follow up appointments on the same day as my nutritionist appointments to avoid missing excessive time from work for appointments.  My surgeon has been out on medical leave and I donâ€™t have another appointment for 2 more weeks, which will put me at 2 months since Iâ€™ve seen the surgeon or nutritionist.

Iâ€™ve made some changes and upped my protein on my own to avoid losing muscle mass.  Itâ€™s just been so long that Iâ€™ve had a follow up, Iâ€™m worried that they may tell me Iâ€™m consuming too much protein now, is that possible?  Currently consuming 90-100g protein daily."
24 hrs post procedure and could really use some positivity,Yesterday was rough I only had some water and some chicken broth. This morning Iâ€™m still pretty nauseous and very acutely aware of my stomach. I did manage to keep some protein shake down though. Really just looking for some positivity and/or support to help get through the next day or two!
Backsliding little over a year from post-op RNY,"Iâ€™ve slipped back into bad habits and I think I may have already stretched my pouch to the point where itâ€™s not keeping me from over-eating.  
I hit a stall 7 months out of surgery (down 70 lbs at that point.) Got frustrated and depressed and have done literally everything wrong but go back on soda. Leading to a gain of about 10 lbs over the last 3 months or so.
Iâ€™m working out still at least, but Iâ€™m worried I may have thrown away my best chance at getting meaningful long-term change.  
Has anyone else fallen back into bad habits and been able to arrest the tailspin? Have I pretty much ruined my tool? Iâ€™m so mad at myself. "
Anyone else not have to spend the night after surgery?,I am getting sleeved at a surgical center (not a hospital) on 8/13 and I just found out I wonâ€™t have to spend the night. Iâ€™m pretty surprised by this so I wanted to hear from others about their experiences.
Butt padding,I did my first semi-long car ride in the driverâ€™s seat since my surgery and my tookus hurt so much! Down a little over 70 pounds and a lot of butt padding!
Date ideas (liquid diet),"Iâ€™m trying to come up with some ideas for a first date this weekend but Iâ€™m running into some wls-related difficulties. Iâ€™m recovering poorly from my surgery and still on a liquid diet, and not feeling very energetic, so food related things like dinner are out and I wouldnâ€™t be jazzed to do something like hiking or even really going for a walk. Iâ€™m driving quite a ways to meet this guy so Iâ€™m not sure I want to just meet for coffee for less time than it took me to drive there. Any brilliant ideas? Iâ€™m at my wits end.
UPDATE: We decided to go to a movie and then get coffee."
Cheering section,Does anyone feel like discouraged because they get so hype about losing weight or completing things on their checklist that they need before surgery and you tell your family and friends and theyâ€™re not as hype about it as you? Like I got cleared yesterday and all I need is the surgical consult after losing almost 40 lbs? Am I crazy? Iâ€™ve worked so hard and I want to celebrate it. Just hard when the people around me donâ€™t make it well known. Idk maybe I should pop the ego and work on humbling myself. Lol
"A few months away from wls, has anyone else been given these books?",
Did I make the right choice?,"Im having second thoughts...not about applying for wls but about the one I chose. A bit of back story...I started my journey back in August and completed all of the requirements for surgery. Two months before the end of my diet, I had to accept a job to take care of my roommate and our fur babies. We had no other choice and because of it, I lost my coverage. Since then, I've been fighting and clawing my way back to getting coverage because my new one lists it as an exclusion. Well, now it looks like I might have won against the insurance company and am expecting them to send me the official approval. 

I was very much on the fence about whether I wanted the sleeve or the bypass. Both had attractive qualities and condeming cons but none of them out weighed the benefit of losing my excess weight. Because of a few factors, one being an uncontrollable Type 2 diabetes diagnosis, I chose the RNY. After seeing my roommate go through the recovery after her own sleeve gastrectomy, im wondering if I made a mistake. I know they are similar but im having a lot of nerves about the extra bits and them having to you know....sew my intestines to my stomach pouch and all that. I don't know. 


Maybe it's just general nerves but a part of me wonders if I should have played it safe and gone with the sleeve. Which is disordered thinking in and of itself because neither is easy to recover from and neither is an easy fix."
What are things you bought pre-op to make post-op easier?,"I'm thinking of examples like a wedge pillow, pregnancy pillow, tummy wrap, etc."
Two weeks prior to surgery diet question,"My surgeon wants me following what our programs considers ""Stage 2"". This stage is titled protein shakes. From the paperwork, it is basically nothing but protein shakes. If they want me around 1,000 calories in a given day I cannot figure out how to do that without taking in more protein than they said to aim for. I had almost 200 grams of protein yesterday and was around 980ish calories. They said to aim for 60-70 grams of protein. The paperwork doesn't say that I can have anything other than protein shakes. 


Am I doing something wrong? The dietician's office is closed until Monday so I cannot call them."
7 Weeks of Leave,"Warning: Rant incoming.

I don't really know where else to post this, but I thought this sub might understand the most. A few weeks ago I posted about the complications I had during my surgery (threw up over a liter of blood, low hemoglobin, fast heart rate, trouble breathing). I thought it was getting better after they gave me transfusions. I was still having mild 'attacks' in my chest if I over-exerted myself (had to stop and clutch my chest because my heart was beating so hard), but I could walk around more or less okay if I walked slow.

Last week I saw my surgeon and he sent me back to the hospital because I mentioned I was still having heart/breathing issues and I thought my blood count might still be a little low. The did CT scans/xrays (again even though they were clear two weeks before when I was in the hospital for a week). They basically did nothing but give me water and said I was probably a little dehydrated. No mention of the fact that my hemoglobin count had gone back down a bit (9.8 to 9.2. Lowest was 6.4 before transfusions and my normal is like 15+)

At this point I just decide to see my primary care and she looks over literally all of my notes since surgery and said 'Why did they not put you on high doses of iron? Your blood transfusion is about to expire. Your blood counts are going down again. I don't understand why they're not more concerned. You lost more than half the blood in your body, of course you feel terrible. I'm afraid you're going to go into cardiac arrest if you keep walking up and down the stairs at your house.' That all shocked me. No one told me transfusions were temporary. No one told me to double/triple my iron to increase blood counts. No one said cardiac arrest was even a remote possibility. Like I know my surgeon team is awesome with the actual bypass surgery, but good grief they had me thinking I was more or less fine.

I'm just so angry right now because the surgeon team has given me so much support, but they seriously fucked this piece up. Now instead of two weeks of leave, I'm now taking seven and have to literally lay in bed for two to three weeks. Even though I can work from home my job requires me to speak on the phone almost all day and I can barely keep my breath after talking for five minutes.. so it was a big no go. My coworkers are covering all my work and I'm so guilty. I'm a workaholic and I'm itching to get back, but I know that I have to listen to my PCP because she's been working with me for over 7 years and I trust her."

Itchy incisions after gastric sleeve surgery,My largest incision is suuuuuper itchy and has just today (a bit over a week after surgery) gotten some weird red bumps around it. Is this okay?
"Threw up today, quite the hit on my confidence","I tried eating some ground beef today. Had yogurt with it. I think that was fine for a while. Then I chugged some water which put me in instant discomfort and pain. I felt like my belly was full and water could not go down. Such a strange feeling.

Threw up and felt fine for a while. But my stomach burn still hurts after 5 hours. More importantly, I lost my water confidence. I would take 3 big sips at least before this incident.

I think I will feel better in the morning. Felt like this was a significant event to share. 

What would be the cause of this incident? My water chugging or the beef? When should I try again?"

Looking for support - 3 days post-op RNY bypass," 

Hey guys,

This morning I was sent home from hospital after 3 nights. My surgery was fine, nothing unexpected was found. I've had bad, bad gas pains and burping a lot from it (so very painful when trying to sip my water) and I'm also so fatigued I'm only awake for about 5 hours a day. Today I just got home and fell asleep, then managed a short walk around my room trying to have some water (I've only had about 400mls today which seems awfully low), then basically just lay in pain in bed until tea time.

I feel sick (I do have anti-nausea meds) and really depressed that I've made the wrong choice. It's been a struggle for me to deal with the pain in addition to trying to get all this fluid in when it hurts quite a lot each time I sip (and I do take it slowly). It may sound silly but it feels like there's no light at the end of the tunnel, just fatigue and feeling like I'm never going to be able to eat again. I'm in some support groups online but I don't get many replies which makes me feel a lot more isolated with my experience.

If you could share your journey with me, I hope that will help. Thanks in advance."

When to tell work about surgery,"From what Iâ€™ve read, I know a lot of people donâ€™t tell work about surgery, or if they do, not the specific type. Now, I donâ€™t know if I want to reveal whatâ€™s it for, but I do want to let them know in advance that Iâ€™ll be out. Iâ€™ll be done with the six month process in July, so Iâ€™m anticipating surgery anywhere from July to September. Iâ€™ve also heard that sometimes, theyâ€™re able to schedule surgery as soon as two weeks from the consultation. Would this be adequate time to tell work that Iâ€™ll be out for about 4-6 weeks (I have a physical job)? Or would it be preferable to give them an estimate of when I might be out? For what itâ€™s worth, itâ€™s a part time, non-benefitted position, so itâ€™s not like I would have to submit any paperwork, but it would be nice not to be fired.

Thanks!"
"Having reservations, have a question","I'm currently doing a clinical ""trial"" to fulfill my insurance's requirements to cover the procedure for the vsg.

What about drinking water while working out?

BMs after WLS (When? Frequency?),"I havenâ€™t had a BM since last Monday (surgery was 7/30/19). I was planning to start some Colace tomorrow. When I first got home, nausea, pain, and hydration were my only thoughts. (Doctor approved Colace and a few other things tooâ€”every doctor is different! #FlameProtectedQuestion)


Iâ€™m passing gas easily and burping. I heard those are good signs!

I donâ€™t feel particularly bloated or pained like Iâ€™ve had with constipation, but I also know that my diet likely doesnâ€™t have much â€œresidue.â€ I mean, for 2 weeks Iâ€™ve had protein shakes, broth, and water. 

Thoughts? Experiences?"
What new things do you do after wls?,"I had bypass on the 19th of December, and I'm still getting used to the diet regimen (though I'm doing well). I'm starting to realize I need something else to occupy my time. Not only am I not spending as much time cooking, eating, or planning meals, but I find I have more energy already! 

So far I've used the extra energy for cleaning and getting all my laundry caught up. I've also been coloring, since a friend gave me a book and markers after surgery. But what's next? I need to figure out how to occupy myself now, and later on when I can be more active after healing. So what new hobbies or activities have you started after wls?"
Beginners questions,"hey all! I am a 22-year-old female who has recently begun looking into WLS. I actually just came from my doctor who sent out a referral for me. I've also been on this subreddit quite a lot looking at other's experiences and such. I anticipate moving forward with this and posting on here for guidance/advice/inspiration/etc but for now, I have a few beginners questions.

1. How long was it from your referral (or first appointment) to your surgery? (I know this can be a very long process, I'm just curious to see what the average tends to be)

2. My doctor let me know I'll need to stop smoking weed as they will drug test me. Not super pumped about that but obviously will do it in order to move forward with this. Does anyone know why they don't want you smoking (including medical marijuana which I have)? I'm curious about the reasoning. (edit: obviously I know about munchies affecting your weight loss but didn't know if there was another reason or not) Were your doctors super strict about this as well? 

3. Any advice for someone contemplating WLS? I'm a little scared already but know it'd be worth it to get back to feeling like myself.

Edit: 4. How long was your initial post op recovery? Like how many days did you need to take off before you were able to return to your regular routine? (school, work, etc.)

Thanks!! :)"
How do you build your meals post-op?,"Iâ€™ve seen a lot of posts on instagram of folks showing a before and after of their plates during meals. My understanding is that we should aim for a 1/4 to a 1/2 cup of food per meal, but looking at some of these plates it seems people are eating way less! 

Looking for input from people who are post-op on how you build your plates. Is aiming for 2 ounces of protein, and an ounce or two of veggies a good place to start? Once you have your plate built, do you aim to eat the whole 4 ounces, or still wait and take it super slow to see if less makes you full?

These questions are rooted in fear of being able to tolerate higher volumes of food too early on, and thus risking stretching out my stomach, so I thank everyone for your input!"
"Help with types of iron supplements, please.","I just got over a health issue (unrelated to wls) that dropped my hemoglobin and iron to ridiculously low levels. I had an iron infusion but my doc wants me to up my iron supplements to 65mg 2x daily. 

Now Iâ€™m a bit confused about whatâ€™s best to use. Thereâ€™s different types of iron (ferrous sulfate, fumerate, carbonyl iron etc) and googling has just left me feeling overwhelmed with all the info. Elemental iron doses differently than sulfate, some require more gastric acids.. Iâ€™m lost. 


What type of iron should we take after wls? I had RNY if it makes difference.

How long after surgery did you reach a steady caloric intake? Was it all of a sudden? Gradual? Something else?,"I am about 6.5 weeks post surgery.

I decided to get  a wls. Iâ€™m not sure which one is right for me as Iâ€™m just starting to contact insurance, doctors, etc., but Iâ€™ve decided to get it done.  Reading all of you guys/gals going through it is encouraging, really is, and Iâ€™ve had two family members go through with one as well. Iâ€™m just scared of everything. Itâ€™s a daunting task ahead of me and I donâ€™t quite know how to work through it all in my head. 

Iâ€™m currently still in school for my CS degree, so I acknowledge that some habits like eating at my computer is going to be hard to break but I have to do it. To this, Iâ€™m scared of the scheduling, timing and any complications interfering with school. 

Iâ€™m also scared of how my relationships will change. Everyone Iâ€™ve ever met since elementary school has known me as the chubby, then fat guy of the group. That sudden shift is bound to garner questions and currently, my mindset is that I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll want to divulge that I had a wls. I guess, in my mind, I still see it as a failure within myself to opt for this because I always told myself I wouldnâ€™t let myself get as big as my relatives that did it. I donâ€™t know why I feel this way, but Iâ€™ve always had and will continue to have a great support system. Again Iâ€™m just scared of what things will change. 

If youâ€™ve read this far, thank you for doing so, Iâ€™d appreciate any and all advice that anyone might have."
My hospital keeps changing my appointments and I'm getting pissed.,"This is just a rant but I need to share it somewhere. 

I met with my surgeon two weeks ago and she set me a surgery date of January 14th at 7:00am and said that was a good time since I'd be the first patient of the day. I also set up and endoscopy on Friday the 11th since I don't work Fridays and I wouldn't have to take any time off. 

Last week I got a call and said they couldn't do my endoscopy on Friday and could I  move it to Monday the 7th. I mean, I guess, if I don't have any other option, but now I also have to take the 7th off from work, but shit happens so whatever. 

Just now I got an e-mail from the scheduler at the bariatric office telling me when to arrive for my sleeve surgery scheduled at noon.  NOON? I was told 7:00am. So I e-mailed her back and asked why it was being moved and her words were *""Surgery schedules often change so like cases can be scheduled together. We try to give you an estimate when you are here for planning purposes.""*

Except at no point was it presented as a time that was an estimate and now I'm getting a little freaked out at the competency of the hospital. 

Arrrg! I'm just ready for this to be done with. "
Honeymoon period,"Wondering how long the honeymoon period after surgery usually lasts, like when you drop the most weight? I am waiting for my surgery consultation, I am just wondering how long the period usually lasts."

Water bottle recommendations,"Iâ€™m scheduled for surgery sept 9 and starting the liquid pre diet soon, and all of my water bottles are the kind with straws so Iâ€™m looking to buys some new ones, anyone have any favorites? Also do you think there is a size thatâ€™s most convenient oz wise?"
Multivitamins??,"So Iâ€™m at 5-6 weeks out of surgery and have not been taking my multivitamin. I know shame on me, but the reason being is because it makes me sick. I have the Bariatric Advantage MV pill and it has this weird smell and taste, and the few times I took it it made me throw up and left me with a stomach ache. I know itâ€™s the pill because I never threw up even once before I took it and never again after I stopped. Iâ€™m not looking for my MV to taste like chocolate or candy but just something tolerable for me. Any recommendations? Yes the chewable (fake starbursts) are disgusting."

Time line between seminar and first appointment,"I have been heavy since high school and have been cycling between 250 and over 300 pounds since I was 31. I have lost the same 50 pounds and regained it 4 times now.

 Highest weight was 315 after the birth of my daughter in 2016. Got down to 266 on Keto then stalled but regained after being diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in 2018. Between being put on prednisone and then pain causing me to not pay as much attention to my calories my weight went back up to 305 when I had a doctor visit last month and I've only been able to lose 6 pounds since then. The last few weeks I've been tracking on my fitness pal and lost nothing. I feel like my metabolism is shot. I'm no longer on prednisone but am taking methotrexate and aleve for my RA.

My biggest issues are stress eating, snacking too much and portion control. I have depression and PCOS in addition to RA and am insulin resistant.

I'm currently 38 and my mom is 61 and has struggled with her weight for a long time as well. She has a WLS date scheduled in 2 weeks and it hit me that I need to do this now and not wait until I'm 61.

My insurance BCBS of IL covers it. Coworkers have had it covered without an issue. I've talked to a plan administrator on the phone and due to my BMI it shouldn't be an issue to get it covered as long as I use a center of distinction. There is only one nearby but coworkers have used it and had a good experience. I am hoping to have a VSG due to needing to take NSAIDs for my RA

I did the seminar last week and turned in all the paperwork to the surgeon's office on Friday. Was told they would contact me back to schedule an initial appointment. How long does that usually take? "
RNY v VSG for CW 230,"Hi everyone,

I met my surgeon today and I am already scheduled to see a nutritionist and have my psych eval on 9/5/19. I'm hoping to get the surgery complete by end of year. I will need two more trips to the nutritionist.

I feel like my doctor is nudging me towards gastric sleeve. Although he says it is ultimately my decision. I'm 5'3 CW 230 - HW 250.

1. Any anecdotes regarding either RnY or VSG for similar body types?
2. Also, any medical journals regarding either? I'd like to make a highly informed decision. I already know the basic differences between the two. I'd like to know some statistics.

Thanks all!"

Life after cancer,Has anybody gotten weight loss surgery after surviving cancer?  Did it help with fatigue?
Please help me figure out how this all works,"I'm 39. Having the second and final baby in 2 months. I've managed to not gain weight during this pregnancy (yay!) but I've still been bouncing around the BMI 40 mark for a couple years. I was above it when I got pregnant this time - something I deeply, deeply regret.  


I'm seriously considering RnY surgery, but I don't even know where to start with all of this. I have excellent insurance - Federal Employee BCBS that lists the requirements as:  


* \- Diagnosis of morbid obesity for 1 year prior to surgery
* \- Medically supervised weight-loss program for three months before the surgery
* \- Pre operational nutritional counseling
* \- Evidence that previous attempts at weight loss in the 1 year period prior to surgery have been unsuccessful
* \- No smoking in the 6 months before
* \- Psych clearance

How/where do I get all of this stuff? And what if in the 3-month weight loss program prior to surgery I lose enough to go under the BMI of 40 line?"
3-Week Stall,"Hi all,

Iâ€™ve really enjoyed this community! It has been so nice to share experiences with others going through similar struggles. 

Iâ€™m almost 100% sure this has been a topic posted before, but Iâ€™m not sure how to search for it. I had a duodenal switch with gallbladder removal on 6/12 and lost 16 pounds in the first 1.5 weeks. I was obviously excited and a little surprised. However, since then Iâ€™ve only lost 2 pounds and the scale has not moved in over a week. Iâ€™ve done some reading online about how it is common and your body is just trying to catch up, but I canâ€™t help but feel a little panicked and discouraged, especially because of how long the stall has lasted. I eat about 500-600 calories a day, get about 80 grams of protein, drink approx 40 ounces of water, and have been taking walks multiple times per week. 

I guess Iâ€™m just looking for a little reassurance. Thanks!"
"VSG 2.5 years out, canâ€™t stop snacking. Help!","And itâ€™s all my fault. I have no self control. Even when I was heavier pre-op I never snacked this much. I can blame work stress, lack of time, whatever. Itâ€™s still on me and I have to figure out a way to stop. 

Iâ€™m not sure why itâ€™s hit me so suddenly like this.   I did very good for a long time and hardly ever ate sweets or salty snacks but now itâ€™s been both types of food for maybe a month. Sometimes itâ€™s in addition to meals (which are WLS-portions still) and sometimes in replacement to meals. I havenâ€™t weighed myself because Iâ€™m afraid of what the number will be, though my clothes fit mostly the same. Iâ€™m embarrassed to go to my surgeon and admit failure. 

How can I reset and get my head back in the game? I cannot.... CANNOT go back to being as big as I was. Iâ€™m desperate to nip this in the bud before it gets out of control."
How many calories do you eat 2+ years out?,"My dietician said most of her patients can only eat around 800-1100 calories per day before weight starts to come back on. This seems so......low. I could be mistaken, but when I initially started reading up on bariatric surgery it seemed to have a positive effect on metabolism and the body ended up with a lower set point. What my RD states seems to imply the opposite. 

So just out of curiosity, how many of you looked to general calorie calculators that tell you for your height, age, sex, activity level you should have x calories per day and do you find you need to be way below that number or around that number?

Thank you"

Change in surgeons and now apparently surgeries. Wondering if it is really worth it,"So I started my journey almost a year ago.  Had my first appointment with surgeon number 1 in August.  He told me the sleeve would be perfect for me since I have back issues and live on Advil.  However I needed to have a comorbidity so they had to test me for sleep apnea or I could gain 10 lbs.  well stupid me gained weight and didnâ€™t get back in until October.  However I gained 20.  Surgeon 1 said he was leaving that office and going to another one to head the program.  He said I could be referred to another surgeon or follow him.  After my appointment I called my insurance and they said I would be fine to follow him.  November 1 2018 I was his first appointment in his new place.  I started my 6 month weight management class and started tackling the list of test.  I did my swallow test in December which was horrific.  I completed everything else but could never get the office to schedule my endoscopy.  In February I call to remind them he wanted to see me and check on the status of the endoscopy.  They schedule my appointment and tell me I donâ€™t need the endoscopy.  Fast forward to my appointment in March surgeon 1 says I do need it and swears it will be all good to go by my 6 month appointment day of April 5.  Well fast forward another week to me calling his office about the endoscopy and they now tell me my insurance wonâ€™t cover the surgery so they have to refer me to the old office.

Today was my appointment with surgeon 2.  He informs me that I canâ€™t get the sleeve and now have to get a bypass, which means no Advil.  Iâ€™m also looking at maybe two more months for surgery and/or longer due to having to start weight management classes again.  He also throws in ive gained 40lbs since August.  Iâ€™m now crying trying to figure out if this is really worth it.  Iâ€™m worried about complications from a rny and more delays.  Has anyone had this many issues and went through it?  Was it worth it? "
Exercise physiologist wanted me to start doing strength training/lifting weights. I have serious regrets,"So the exercise physiologist asked me to start doing 150 minutes of cardio a week and 3 days of weight lifting. She gave me a little packet with a weight lifting plan with pictures of exercises, how many reps and sets, which days to do them, etc. I honestly didnt do much weight lifting the last two times I lost weight because I kind of hate it, but the exercises she gave me didnt seem too bad and I know how important it is to try to retain my muscle. I got everything I needed to do the strength training at home and started this week. Day one was good, no issues. A little sore but it was fine. However, on Tuesday I did day two and it had squats listed as an exercise. 3 sets of 10 reps. They were a struggle but I did them, did my cardio, good to go.  

Well, I'm regretting those freaking squats. My thigh muscles are so sore and painful I cant do anything. Walking hurts, sitting on the toilet hurts, going up and down the stairs in my house is horrible. The pain is so obnoxious I ended up taking Tylenol for it yesterday because my legs were keeping me awake. And I had to skip my exercise totally last night because there is just no way.  

Is weight lifting supposed to be *this* punishing? I have to work tonight and I'm legitimately concerned I'm going to struggle to do my job because of how sore I am. I cant imagine dealing with this for weeks on end while I try to strengthen those muscles. I'm still almost 300 pounds, is that just too heavy to be doing stuff like squats (and lunges, those are on my sheet too)? Is there some kind of modified squat I should do?"
At what point were you low enough to fit on most roller coasters?,"My stats are in my flair but just in case, I'm 5'8, 275 currently. Friend of mine was hoping we could go to cedar point in June. Obviously I cant predict my weight loss, but at what weight can people typically ride all of them?  

Edit: or maybe more accurate, what BMI? I'm scared of driving all the way up there and just not fitting into anything. We can do the trip in july or august if needed but I have no idea what the tipping point is. "

What itâ€™s like getting a sleeve in Japan,"Hi folks,

I just had my sleeve done in Tokyo. Iâ€™m a 38 year old man with a BMI approaching 50. Iâ€™m not Japanese but Iâ€™ve lived here for the better part of 20 years. 

PRESURGERY: I was referred to my hospital by my local doctor. Over the past few years Iâ€™ve dieted and worked out but unfortunately it never seemed to result in regular weight loss. Last year I injured my knee, which put an end to my going to the gym. After I was referred I had a series of meetings at the hospital with the surgeon, an internal specialist, a psychologist, and a dietician. I was put on a special diet and then asked to check in to hospital for a special two-week course to reduce my weight as much as possible. I lost about 8kg during this time. I was also subjected to further tests, including an MRI, and they took roughly six metric tons of blood from me â€” I didnâ€™t know I had so much to begin with. 

SURGERY: Once the all clear arrived I was given a laxative to clean me out, asked to shave my beard (the horror!), and had my chest shaved. On the morning of the surgery I went down to the theatre on my own, was positioned, and within a few minutes they injected the anesthetic and we were off. The anaesthetic felt strangely cold and painful. I woke what felt like an instant later with the doctors saying my name, and asked a few questions like where I was. I was still super groggy but I managed. 

POST SURGERY: Hands down the worst part. First up is of course the sheer dreadful pain of it all. Imagine the worst stomach ache youâ€™ve had and multiply that by a hundred. Also, you spend a lot of the first three days throwing up blood and other stuff. I donâ€™t know about the quality of pain management here but there were definitely times I wanted to assault the nurses because of how slow they were with the anti-nausea and pain medication. The good news is it doesnâ€™t last too long â€” within 30 hours or so I began to feel mostly human again. 

RECOVERY â€” After 24 hours in the ICU, I was given a sponge bath, and taken back up to the ward. One of the nurses here was a little rough, so I complained, and she didnâ€™t come near me after that. Over the next three days I was decatherized (thank God) and had my drips removed. I had one mishap in the toilet where I didnâ€™t press on the hole left by a drip hard enough and basically bled everywhere. At this point, Iâ€™m five days out from surgery, and my main issues are threefold:

1. Eating. You have to eat very slowly â€” a tablespoon of soup every 3 mins â€” or you throw up or belch really hard. Itâ€™s difficult to stay hydrated with this, so youâ€™ve got to keep an eye on that. Also, like I said â€” you will belch. A LOT. 

2. Pain â€” the main pain is from the port sites, which are basically stab wounds. Theyâ€™re still red and a little puffy, and hurt when I move. Stomach pain is nearly entirely gone, though weirdly enough I am feeling hungry quite a lot. 

3. Sleep â€” you have to sleep on your back; anything else aggravates the injuries to your stomach. If, like me, thatâ€™s the opposite of how you sleep, you might need sleep aides to catch some zzzs. 

I hope this helps! Itâ€™s definitely a psychological ride. On more than one occasion Iâ€™ve stopped to ponder the fact that a physical part of me â€” with a disproportionately large psychological role â€” is now gone forever. I hope the pain will be worth it. For now though, Iâ€™m leaving hospital today, and looking forward to seeing my dog. Though, come to think of it, heâ€™s rather chubby too..."
Caffeine start up,When did you guys start having caffeine after surgery? Iâ€™m having the rny tomorrow morning and Iâ€™m just wondering when you all started up again. Did you go straight to coffee or did you buffer with tea in between? What surgery did you have? 
Smartwatch = Wise post-op investment!,"I use an apple watch, but I am certain that any tech brand with similar functionalities will work just fine.

I feel that I owe a lot of my success to this tiny little device. It has many different features that allow my post op life to be very organized and straight forward. Specifically the following below was extremely vital:

* I use the timer in order to make sure that I do not eat atleast 30 minutes before and after each meal.
* I have Medisafe enabled on my watch. It is an app that reminds me when to take my multivitamins/supplements, and it automatically records the time that I took them. No more having to remember if I took this or that, or worrying about double dosing in one day.
* I record my workouts, using the workout app. and I pay special attention to the amount of calories burned and the duration of my work out in order to make sure that I am staying active.
* I (used to) record my macros consumed with the myfitness pal watch app. This was critical when I was adhering to 600kcal a day diet. I have reached a point where I do not really need to record everything tic for tac, but it was extremely helpful in the first 6 months post op."
Why does it seem like so many that undergo these surgeries regain? How do you maintain?,"It seems like those who have their surgery regain 15, 30 or 45 pounds and it happens more to them than those who didnâ€™t have it.  It seems to be a good tool though.  What causes this?"

Did anyone else struggle to get their exercise in post-surgery due to lack of energy?,"I was sleeved 05/13/2019, so I'm three weeks out.  I'm supposed to be taking a daily 20-30 minute walk but I'm struggling with this.  I have ZERO energy.  I'm staying active by doing things around the house, and doing things with my kids, and am getting around 6k-7k steps a day, sometimes more.  Pre-surgery I walked all the time, went to the gym, etc and I feel like a slug now lol.  If I try to do too much I get dizzy and weak, though.  I'm hitting my protein goals (usually 60g) but not always my water goals.  I may be a bit dehydrated, but I swear I'm drinking water all day.  I'm getting at least 50oz/day.  I just started purees yesterday and have only had cottage cheese and chicken salad, so maybe it'll get better after I start having some non-liquid meals.  

I'm just kind of frustrated.  I didn't expect to be able to do a full workout by now, but shouldn't I be able to walk 30 minutes without getting dizzy and weak?"
"Done, everything is submitted to Insurance","I went to all the appointments, did all the test. Didnâ€™t gain weight in the 4 months I started. I qualify for RNY and meet all the requirements for my insurance. Iâ€™m just scared it wonâ€™t be approved.

I went into this so confident and excited for my experience. And now I feel like a fragile little baby who canâ€™t even sip some water without feeling pressure 15 minutes later. It subsided after a few seconds but itâ€™s still annoying. It pains my spine.

Iâ€™m overly emotional. Iâ€™m missing my old life. I miss eating normally. Feeling normally. 

And the thing is, I knew all of this is normal. I knew to expect it. I just hate feeling like this, feeling alone in it.

Plus Iâ€™m bored out of my mind watching tv and sipping. Also, bone broth tastes terrible.

The big 100,"I have just officially reached 100 pounds of weight loss since my my peak weight and had surgery back on November 14th. The only ""special"" size I need now is because I am tall. I can walk from class to class without getting completely winded. Strangers are nicer to me. I've been taken off medications because I don't have the problem they were treating anymore. I was actually hit on for the first time in my life.

I'm by no means skinny at this point. I still have a significant amount to lose. But I am doing so much better than I was before. I knew this surgery was going to change my life as a general idea, but I realize now that I didn't understand what those changes would actually feel like. 

I'm can't even express what I am feeling. I wouldn't even know how to explain it to myself from just 6 months ago.  This was one of the best decisions I've ever made.

Its weird but I am starting to think maybe I might be good looking one day. The idea of that has never really crossed my mind. I am actually starting to kind of like myself these days.  Maybe one day I will even love myself. 

When I started this journey with 400 pounds to lose it always seemed so impossible... but now with only  154 pounds to lose.... I think I might actually get there...  I am so excited to see what the future has in store for me.

Can't get past psyc.,"I was referred for weight loss surgery from my primary back in September and approved by my insurance in October. I've completed all the requirements from my insurance except for getting approved by psyc and I'm a few pounds away from my pre-surgery recommended weight.

The psychologist they sent me to is not the normal one the Bariatric program uses, but due to lack of available appointments, they had me see him. He's required sixteen weeks of therapy before he'd consider approving me for surgery. It took me several months to find a therapist that specialized in eating disorders, was accepting new patients, and was covered by my insurance.

I've completed sixteen weeks of therapy, but I've only lost ten pounds of the thirteen my surgeon wanted me to lose (which they say is okay and they'll still do the surgery). But the therapist is saying that because of this, I'm not ready for surgery because I'm not losing the weight on my own like I should if I had my binge eating under control.

I'm so frustrated because isn't the point of having the surgery is that I need help to lose weight? I need another tool to help me with the process, I can't do this one my own, I tried for years and years. I'm feeling really discouraged at this point and don't know what to do."
A question about calorie counting (and its importance),"Hi all.
I'm 7 weeks post-op and I am finding that it is now quite easy for me to get my 70-80g of protein in throughout the day. 

My dietician and I never once discussed how many calories I should be aiming for in a day. She provided extensive info regarding WHAT I should eat and what my macros should look like but never specified how much calories I should be having. I'm wondering if anyone else calorie counts? On the days where I reach 80g of protein, I'm eating somewhere around 700-800 Calories a day. Some days I can only hit 60-70g of protein, and those days I have around 600 calories. 

I guess I'm just asking whether these numbers add up/ I'm on the right track calorie wise. 

Thanks"

Did anyone else have labs similar to these. Iâ€™m still waiting for my inflammation labs to come in. Those take longer to process. 


**thanks wls, I love this community.**

**update:**

Doc told me not to worry about it. I'm going to trust him on this. ~~less stress = less fat right?~~ 

**update 2:** 
My labs link if anyone wants to take a look

This might be a shot in the dark,"But did anyone break out after surgery? Iâ€™m two months out and my skin is so bad, and not just on my face. My legs even have spots and my love handles are sooo dry and get spots. It could be totally unrelated to surgery, but I just wondered if anyone else had the same experience. All Iâ€™ve been drinking is water and hardly ever had refined or added sugar. Maybe Iâ€™m not drinking enough? I also hit my protein goal daily. Like I said, could be unrelated but figured this was a good place to ask!! "
"Stereotypical ""need to vent"" post. Also, experience with FMLA?","I'm still smack-dab in the middle of pre-op, and I'm really stressing about my potential surgery date. I have all of my pre-op appointments already scheduled, except for the psych eval.

If I had to guess, I will probably be offered a date in either September or October. September is terrible because my boss is going to Thailand, and theres several other employees taking time off in my department already. There probably won't be anyone to cover my shifts.

My boss is great and told me to take any date, even if its September, but I don't want to stress about my workload while I'm taking time off. I work in the admissions department of a non-profit healthcare facility, and there are few other employees that are trained in my position. So I also have to scramble to train someone (hopefully) in the midst of all this pre-op crap.

I can't do October either, because my mom decided last minute to go on vacation even  though she knew I'd be having surgery around that time. I'm glad shes going to go have fun, but part of me is annoyed because she knew this surgery was coming up and how stressed I am. But I didn't say anything other than I'm happy for her. She has sacrificed a lot for me and I don't want to get in the way of her vacation.

I'm also stressed about about the FMLA paperwork. I'm very confused about the process and HR seems to busy to sit down with me and explain what to do.

I'm 23 and this is my first ""real"" job, so I know nothing about FMLA. It seems like they just expect me to know what to do. I've never felt like such a kid than I do now.

Sorry for the long misguided rant. This sub has been a huge outlet for me, and has given me more information and advice than any doctor, phone call, or google search has gotten me. Thank you all &lt;3"
Questions,"Hello!! 

Iâ€™m 24 CW is 230 and Iâ€™m 5â€™7â€ female. 

-My insurance covers WLS.
-debating between the sleeve and bypass and leaning towards the bypass. Any opinions on this ? Bypass seems more successful 
-my insurance requires six months of meeting with a nutritionist and a diet and exercise program which I started back in November
-Iâ€™ve had to get a mental evaluation, blood work, and an exam where they had to make sure my stomach looked ok for surgery by placing a camera down my throat
-I still need to get a cardiac clearance and complete my sleep study 

So my surgery date should be sometime around April or May.

I have an office job and I want to use my vacation time for the surgery. REALISTICALLY how long do I need to be out for an office job ? What is the recovery like ! I need lots of details !  

Also this is embarrassing for me to need this surgery. I donâ€™t want to tell any coworkers I am getting the surgery. Is the weight loss something I can play off as I am starting to work out more and losing weight naturally ? Or is it more dramatic?


advice ? Comments ?  I want to know it all !"
Eating is So Hard,"I cannot fathom how it's possible for people to eat 700 calories after surgery. The first three weeks we had to maintain 500-600 calories. Yeah right I could get down one protein shake a day 160 calories + scoop of extra protein and pb2 to up the calories. So maybe 250-300 calories a day. I was stuffed and had zero hunger. Plus I could barely get in 50 oz of water on top of that. Now I'm cleared for pureed/soft foods and I feel like I'm getting even less. Refried beans with cheese, scrambled eggs with cheese, mashed potatoes. Sure they're higher in calories but I'm still stuffed after a spoonful. Dietician is worried because I've had to get IV fluids and supplements twice in three weeks.

Is there some kind of trick someone can give me? This is so frustrating."
"9 months and 177 pounds off. If you think you can't do it, you can.",
I.F. after wls,"I am about 14 months out from the gastric sleeve surgery. I am down about 90lbs (274 start weight and currently bouncing around the 180s for over a month). 

I started intermittent fasting a week ago and so far so good. Tomorrow will be a dreaded scale day so only time will tell if IF has kick-started the weight loss.

I am just curious about others experience with IF after wls.

I am doing 16/8 - so 16 hours of fasting

I take in about 600-800 calories - i have a desk job and at the moment not getting much more than 30 minutes of walking each day

I do drink well over a gallon of water a day, 2 meals protien/veggie very low carb, if i snack it is usually mixed nuts, if i need a sweet usually a fruit will take the craving.
"
Iâ€™m a little over two weeks out and Iâ€™m experiencing a stall (vent),"Iâ€™m stalling, and itâ€™s really depressing. I have read on other places and from others that itâ€™s common after two weeks. I get all my fluids in (something I struggled with since I got out, so Iâ€™m proud of that) and Iâ€™ve been making my protein goal with the exception of yesterday (I tried something that didnâ€™t agree and I experienced my own version of throwing up). 

Maybe Iâ€™m constipated. Maybe Iâ€™m not. My mom tells me Iâ€™m way too in my head about it and I worry that I am. How do you eat every 2-3 hours?? How do you break the stall? Iâ€™m tired all the time - even after taking the recommended vitamins. I just ordered b12 per my nutritionist so maybe that will help move the scale. Iâ€™m walking, not back to full on working out. But Iâ€™m walking a lot. 

I feel like Iâ€™m already failing. 

Thanks for letting me vent. You guys are cool. "
Rapid Weight Gain,"Guys. I'm in trouble. I've gained 30 lbs back in the last year. Granted, I was working out 2 hours some days. I was eating better, more active and happy.

I started a new job last year and it left me very depressed. I stopped caring about my fitness, snack too much and most of me just doesnt care about myself. I'm slowly creeping back up in weight and I want to care before I'm right back where I used to be.

How do I snap out of this and get healthy again? Lose the 30 lbs?

Just a wake up call that wls wasnt going to hold forever. :("
Afraid of wls because of hairloss,"This may be really ridiculous and vain, and i mean no offense. Iâ€™m in the process of finishing up my requirements for weight loss surgery and im so scared to lose a lot of my hair. My doctor said it will happen but i can help lessen it by taking biotin, collagen and making sure i hit my protein goals. But im so scared. I used to have really thick hair and i guess itâ€™s still semi full, but its been shedding a lot as iâ€™ve grown older (27) and i thinned a bit on my edges. I almost want to  quit because its taken me so long to grow out my hair again and I canâ€™t even imagine cutting it or losing a big chunk of it:(((.

Have a lot of you guys struggled with this too?"
Finally Got a Date after 7 months! Few Questions,WOO! Its been back and forth for 7 months and now I finally got a surgery date! 9/3! I am having the duodenal switch. I am 34 so youngish but have a lot of gut and arm skin. Will most of it shrink back or should I go ahead and plan for plastic surgery? Is there a lotion that will help tighten areas while I'm loosing the weight? Is there a way to avoid a lot of rash and pain from rubbing of saggy skin?
Itâ€™s my 2yr surgiversary!,
Few questions to the people that has done any form of a gastric surgery...,"1. What are the pros/cons?
2. Would you recommend it? (or rather, is there a reason you'd advise someone against it)?
3. Any cautions one should consider if they were to go through with it? 
4. What are the immediate effects post-op? and long-term ones?
5. Any mental changes (good and/or bad) as a result of the operation?
6. Your experience with loose skin?

&amp;#x200B;

thank you for taking the time to answer"
Help!,I am 2 kg's away from being able to get the process of wls started. I got my doctors appointment tomorrow. Any tips?
Stalled and discouraged,"I'm five months post op RNY, and I am so, so discouraged right now. I know stalls are a Thing and I usually take them in stride, but I've been stalled for a month and I'm wondering if this is just... it. I'm down 50lbs from surgery, 70 from starting optifast. My starting weight was 352, and I'm sitting around 282 now. They calculated my expected weight loss at 70 lbs and I know it would be weird to stop losing at this point but it's got to happen to some people, right?

I've been trying to work the food program but I am so insecure about it. Am I stalled because I'm eating too many carbs? Not enough? Am I taking in too many calories? My brain is telling me even on my worst days there's no way I'm cracking 1500 calories let alone the 2300 I'd need to sustain my current weight. I know the stall is probably due to things like stress, struggling to take in liquids, balancing veg and starches, not sleeping well, possibly my cycle (which had me retaining 5 lbs water weight last month wtf I almost shat myself when the scale went up that much but relaxed when it went down after). But it feels like maybe I fucked up my innards and won't be getting the fantastic weight loss everyone hopes for.

I guess, I just need some encouragement. Tell me about your long-ass stalls and the times you got hope back after feeling hopeless."
Numbers One Year &amp; One Month Out from RNY: No Longer Obese,"I was gonna post on my 1 year surgiversary, but I was so close to my BMI Milestone that I waited until I hit it.  I am no longer obese (5'10"", RNY, Male).  I've hit some plateaus/stalls here and there.  I've done some serious traveling (Cyprus, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Tanzania, etc...) in the last year, so I ""fell off"" of my plan from time to time.  But, I keep on making progress.  I keep on doing my weekly meal prep.  I keep on swimming, cycling, and things have picked up a bit more now that I've added some weight training into the mix.  I'm not going nuts on the weight training, but I can tell I've lost a good amount of muscle since my surgery.

I am down over 200 lbs from my HW, and 160 since my RNY surgery.  I've had no major complications at this point.  I have a pretty good belly flap from my deflated gut, and if I was done losing I'd get that bastard cut off and probably drop another 15 lbs.  In the last year I've cycled through a shit-ton of clothes.  My button-downs have gone from a 22 inch neck to a mere 17, though I need to buy a 16.5 and a 16 to see how they fit.  My weight is still in my gut so I am still a bit larger in the gut.  I'm comfortably wearing a size 36 trouser over my gut flap.   I am exploring the world of non-Big &amp; Tall shopping and going between an XL shirt and a L.  My shoes are loose, as are my hats.  I've been ramping down the pressure on my BiPap/Cpap and I am close to stopping that completely.  I will get tested to make sure that I no longer have sleep apnea.  Getting rid of the BiPap was a big motivation for me, and I'm excited to see it go.  

Other big wins for me are:

It is easy to get up off the floor/ground

Easier to poop on an airplane

Using urinals in the bathroom instead of a stall

Taking the stairs and not feeling like dying

When I get dressed in the morning, my trousers look like they are way to small to possibly fit me....BUT THEY DO!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Getting the surgery (self paid, btw) was one of the best things I've ever done in my life, and I wish that I would have done it back 10 years ago when my doctor first recommended it to me.  Hell, my insurance at the time probably would have covered the cost!   For those deciding about the surgery, start listening to the Weight Loss Surgery Podcast because there is a ton of great info in the show.

My next target (sooo close) is breaking the 200 lbs point, and then seeing how close to 174 lbs (the top of my ""normal"" BMI range) that I can get to before I level off entirely.

Iâ€™m not obese anymore.,"For the first time since I was 15, I am not obese. I have been obese nearly my entire life, and last year I reached a new high of class 3 obesity, sometimes called super morbidly obese. My BMI was 51.2 at my highest. Today, I got on the scale to see the lowest weight I have been in 15 years, since I was barely a teenager, and my weight is down to 169, which puts me BMI at 29.9. That means I am no overweight, but not obese. Itâ€™s the first time in my adult life that I have been this small, and there is damage to my body, mostly my skin, as a result, but I am so excited to be where I am, and canâ€™t wait for the day I see 141, which will put me at a normal BMI. My goal weight is between 125 and 135, but Iâ€™m not sure where because I have always been fat. Still, Iâ€™m in a better place now then I have ever been. "
Surgery Date is Next Wednesday! What do I need?,"Hey everyone, so I posted a bit of a rant the other day about how my HMO was seemingly prolonging the process. Well, that seemed to have changed starting yesterday afternoon and I couldn't be more thrilled! 

They squeezed me in for a psych appointment this morning and I guess I passed with flying colors. I just got a call from the surgeon about an hour ago asking if I'd be ready for surgery next Wednesday. I said absolutely. 

This is suuuuuuper unexpected and exciting. I wasn't expecting them to be able to schedule the surgery for at least another month.  

I'm also of course, nervous. I feel like there are things that I haven't thought about yet. One thing I want to make sure is that I have the stuff I need. Here's my list:

* protein shakes

* veggie broth (I'm a vegetarian)

* other soft foods (applesauce, yogurt, etc etc)

* abdominal binder (should I get one of these?)

* pregnancy pillow (I feel like I should probably get one as I am a side/stomach sleeper)

* gas-x strips

* vitamins 

Anything else I should get? I only have a few days to prepare and won't have someone to help get last minute supplies so I am trying to make sure I'm ready to go.

Skin after surgery,"Hello all,  
This is obviously not my usual account as I'm going to discuss some embarrassing things.  
I'm a 30 year old female from Australia. I'm about 1 year and a bit post sleeve. I took to the sleeve well and my weight loss is ""better than expected"", though I am now plateauing around 90kg and now having to really work for the extra loss.  
Coming down from 150kg and being quite tall as well, I knew skin was going to be an issue.  
Now that I am going out in public more, gaining confidence, my skin has become a horrid secret. It's not that I'm secretive about my WLS and skin issues, but when I explain it to friends I don't think they understand how bad it is. I'm pretty good at hiding it all with strategic clothing too, but:  
\- I had large breasts before my surgery and now they're basically sad, limp sacks. I deal with this by essentially shoving them into a moulded cup and covering up, but the skin is so thin and papery I actually end up hurting myself by accident sometimes.  
\- A lot of my weight gain was due to PCOS and with PCOS weight distribution a lot of it was around my crotch. Having lost most of the weight there, my crotch is a  complete disaster - it almost looks like a large, flabby ballsack. I can no longer wear pants unless they're very loose and baggy in that area.   
\- To compound it all, I had a lot of scarring and stretch marks before the surgery, so now afterwards it's a huge mess.  
   
My income is not going to allow me to change this anytime soon with corrective surgery. It's definitely something I'm saving for though. I'm venturing out and dating again but as soon as I see myself in the mirror in the bathroom, all of it comes crashing down and I just hate my body, I question all of my hard work and progress. Being sexual with anyone seems completely impossible and even just masturbating leads to serious body dysphoria. I really don't know what to do.  
On one hand I'd like to hear people's similar experiences and advice. On the other hand I also just want to vent about this candidly. I know a lot of you are still in the pre-losing stage and I want to clarify that I do NOT regret my WLS at all - it was one of the best decisions I've made to take control of my life again. But I'm now in a brand new horrible place and I'm so exhausted and unhappy in a whole new way. "
A Rant,"This will probably be long so I apologise in advance. Also, if you're here to tell me that I'm being a baby or other assorted name, you may kindly shove off. 

8 months ago, my best friend and roommate and I decided to get a consultation with a bariatric surgeon after our primary recommended the surgery. We quickly took off making a bunch of changes and we're cruising through our 6 month medically supervised diet. Well, our financial situation changed and we ended up being homeless and I lost my insurance. So, I had an opportunity to get a new job that would support us. Obviously, I took the job so that we could have a home but the insurance doesn't cover bariatric surgery. I'm desperately trying to find a way to get my surgery but today is hers. She went in for her sleeve gastrectomy this morning and is in recovery now. 

Up until this point, I haven't really told her how badly seeing her continue with the process is affecting me. In no way am I saying she should have stopped or waited for me. I am so happy and so proud of her for following through on this and for taking control of her health. I feel so guilty but I can't help but feel so heartbroken and devastated that I'm not going to surgery with her. We we're supposed to do this together but I couldn't afford to keep going. 

I've been in the corner of the waiting room just silently sobbing since she went in at 9:30 this morning. I need this surgery. I'm at the point where if I don't lose my excess weight quickly in the next year or so, then I will likely be dead. I'm not looking for sympathy or anything. I just needed a place to rant and get this off my chest. I've run out of hope and I want to continue being supportive and a rock for her but I don't know how much longer I can keep a happy face."
Best places to shop?,"Iâ€™m wondering what the best places are to shop for transitional clothing. Iâ€™m thinking like loose dresses and leggings. My birthday is next week and Iâ€™m hoping to ask for some gift certificates! My surgery is on the 9th, and already my clothing is a bit loose. "
"In the middle of my process for wls, just some ventings/anxieties to get off my chest","Hello! Iâ€™m in the process of my journey to wls. I have my 2 month (out of 4) weigh-in appointment this week and Iâ€™ll finally be meeting my surgeon then


Iâ€™m 5â€™6â€ 1/2 and weighed in at 253.6lbs at my 1st weigh-in. So 40bmi, right at the edge. Because of this, I was told by my program that I need to avoid the usual process of losing weight during these 4 months, and I just need to maintain my weight and not go under 40bmi. I was told to stay between 252-255lbs


This is much harder than I anticipated! Especially in the Summer where Iâ€™m sweating a lot and frequently dropping just a pound or so under 40bmi, so then I need to regain back again. I think I wouldâ€™ve had an easier time if I needed to actually lose a certain amount of weight. I just mostly wanted to vent about this, since itâ€™s a little stressful constantly worrying about dropping too low. Anyone else been at the edge of the required BMI and needed to maintain it for however long their program/insurance requires?


My program requests cardiac clearance. I also have a recorded history of a fast heart rate. I also have anxiety, which doesnâ€™t help when Iâ€™m out in public or in doctors offices (Iâ€™ve always had doctor anxiety since I was a child). I am completely healthy, and my cardiologist says everything with me is absolutely fine and says itâ€™s probably just naturally fast heart rate, increased further by anxiety and weight. No palpitations, no irregular rhythm. Itâ€™s just fast, always has been. I have an appointment to get an echo and wear a heart monitor for 24 hours coming up soon that my cardiologist ordered for me just to see my resting/non anxiety heartbeat at home and to check for any spikes while asleep, just in case 


My heart rate tends to average around 120-125bpm while at a doctors office that I know and am more comfortable. It can get up to 140sbpm when Iâ€™m at a new doctor that I donâ€™t know and am unfamiliar with. Plus, Iâ€™m sure the obesity makes it faster as well. My cardiologist referenced a past recorded heart rate in the 140s and said if I came in for surgery with a heart rate that high, the anesthesiologist would cancel the surgery 


SO, that of course is making me worried now. I would be absolutely devastated if I went through this 4 month program and all these required appointments and support groups for nothing. Just to get turned away literally minutes before surgery. I am completely healthy, aside from the obvious obesity. No co-morbidities, no thyroid issues, no sleep apnea, no diabetes, ect. Just the fast heart rate. I have been given a full bill of health by all the doctors my program has required me to see. Now this one thing that is out of my control might ruin it. Cardiac clearance is the last clearance I need, and I canâ€™t get it until after he sees my monitor results. Even if he does clear me, now Iâ€™m finding out it can still get canceled day off because of my heart rate


Has anybody else had to deal with fast heart rate concerns? If my heart rate is high when Iâ€™m being prepped for surgery, canâ€™t I just be sedated before hand? I shouldâ€™ve thought of that question to ask my cardiologist when I saw him, but of course I didnâ€™t think of it until afterwards lol. Iâ€™m planning to ask my surgeon when I meet him for my upcoming weigh in 


Sorry for the long, rambling post! I guess Iâ€™m just wondering if anyone has had either of these issues during their journey, and how it worked out for them. I feel a little better after writing down my worries lol


TL;DR: I have to maintain my 40bmi and have a fast heart rate, naked and afraid"

Afraid of surgeon...,"I'm halfway through my nutritionist visits and I've made big changes.  I've lost 20 lbs since Dec 14.  I've been working out with the program's personal trainer and on my own. Both the trainer and the nutritionist think I'm doing well.

I see the surgeon on Tuesday and I'm terrified. I tried to get wls in 2005 from a different hospital and was rejected by both the nutritionist and the psychiatrist (this psych visit is in another week.). Do I tell the surgeon I got turned down before?  

I don't know what to say or ask.  I'm freaking out about being turned down again.

Waiting on Scheduling,"Hi guys, thanks for being a huge support, even though I'm a long time lurker.

I have all my pre-req's done, and now I""m waiting to get a call back with my scheduling for the surgery. What's your wait time from experience? 

Also, what should I be stocking up on before the surgery? I'm fairly low income (hoping to change after surgery), so any tips would be appreciated.

Much Love!"
Folios Cheese Wraps,
When did you first feel real hunger after WLS?,
Considering WLS (probably VGS). Would I be able to consume 300 calories at once?,"I've been overweight since childhood and obese since my teenage years. I've tried numerous diets including a medically supervised one to no avail. So now I'm considering WLS. I think I'm a pretty good candidate. However, I am on a medication that has to be taken with 300 calories in order to be absorbed properly. It's not something that would resolve with weight loss, and there really isn't any good alternative drug. Would I be able to consume 300 at once after surgery, or should I focus on other means of weight loss?"
I had surgery (sleeve) last Wednesday and I regret it so much,"How long does it take to feel better? I feel like such wimp compared to the other people in my program who had surgery the same day as me. They are off all medication and living life like normal and Iâ€™m so miserable. I feel so bloated all the time. It feels like I ate too much food, but all the time and Iâ€™ve not really eaten anything since surgery. I canâ€™t get enough water in. Drinking is uncomfortable. It stings for a moment, comes back up and then goes back down, so i dread swallowing. I feel like I need to poo all the time but I just sit on the toilet forever unless I take a laxative and then I just feel awful. I have vomited four times and that was so painful and just pure stomach acid. My left side of is so sore and I canâ€™t feel comfortable unless Iâ€™m laying flat on my back. I went to the ER on Saturday and they couldnâ€™t find anything wrong except I was severely dehydrated and there was a strained artery to keep an eye on. The top of one of my thighs is numb and tingly and Iâ€™ve told this is from where they strap you in on the table for surgery and will eventually get better, but could take months. As of right now I regret this so much. Tell me it gets better? Itâ€™s all so much harder that I am a former foster kid with no family or many friends to take care of me so this is a very lonely experience too."

Hair loss at 6 weeks?,"I had RNY on 1/24 and Iâ€™m already losing a noticeable amount of hair.  From everything I have read about hair loss and wls was that it usually doesnâ€™t start until 3 months in.  Iâ€™m 31 and my hair was pretty thick before so itâ€™s becoming very noticeable if you look at the top of my head.

I have a follow up appointment with my surgeon today and I will mention the hair loss to see if he can recommend anything.  Iâ€™ve heard people mention Biotin.  What vitamins/products did you use to minimize hair loss?"

Pre-Op Liver Shrink Diet: Not Losing Weight,"Hello everyone,

I started my journey in December of 2018, weighing 587 pounds.  I am 6'2"", male, and went through a 6 month weight management program through my insurance.

Currently, I am around 510 and 2 weeks from surgery (June 13th is the date).  My surgeon wants me to lose around 15 pounds for the surgery on the liver shrink diet (4-5 protein shakes (premier protein), and 1 low carb meal (chicken breast and non-starch vegetables).

I've noticed my weight hasn't been going down, and I'm starting to get discouraged.  I haven't cheated at all, and I've stuck with the diet to the T.  Is this normal?

Thanks."
Slow weight loss,"Okay, so Iâ€™ve been at the weight loss thing  for six months. And I am thrilled with the 100+ pounds Iâ€™ve lost.  But after the big weight loss while I was only eating 300 calories a day in the first couple weeks after surgery, my weight loss has slowed.  I thought Iâ€™d be losing 20-30 pound per month... Iâ€™m losing about 15.  I am losing less per month after surgery than I was before.

I know that losing is losing, but has anyone else had this effect.Ive been walking and hiking.  I know I need to add strength training.  

Iâ€™m also getting married in October, so Iâ€™d love to see better progress.

Post op diet examples,"Hi fellow WLS friends. 
Iâ€™m seeking a few solid examples of post op diets for the solids phase. My dietician, bless her heart, is very into things I donâ€™t consider terribly healthy, like aspartame and cold cuts and adding a whole cup of strawberries to morning yoghurt. 
This might be a Mexican thing. All my Mexican friends tend towards a very different idea of health. Iâ€™m really into whole foods, greens, healthy fats. Would love to see some examples of 800-1000 cal post-op diets. Thanks!"
FML.. Surgery Date Drama,"So, I made a post about 8 days out and I had a PASE meeting..   


Ive jumped through every hoop, done everything..the Dr informed me that insurance denied it because of missing paperwork. So they resubmitted the paperwork, surgery scheduled on the 26th. they resubmitted paperwork on the 15th.. takes up to 15 calender days to process.   


I should know hopefully by friday, Monday at the latest.. otherwise surgery is pushed back a full month.

insanely stressful. "
Quick question about post-op and Cpap machine,"Night 3 after my surgery I noticed I'm coughing a lot with my cpap machine running. I have lots of water in the machine so it's not dry air causing this all of a sudden. I remove the mask and I sleep fine, don't cough or have the snoring associated with sleep apnea.

&amp;#x200B;

My pressure was set at the highest level for about 6 months before the surgery and never had a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Did anyone else experience coughing due to the pressure being set too high on the machine after RNY?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: SOLVED!!"
Surgery scheduled 8/27!,"I have been through the process and was approved by insurance and will be having my VSG on 8/27. I do have to go in for pre-op testing on the 21st. I am not sure what those test will all include, it says it will take about three hours. What has everyone's experience been with the pre-op testing?"
Did anyone quit added sugar well before surgery?,"Iâ€™ve met with the registered dietician a couple times and really clicked with her. Mentally/emotionally, weâ€™re wired the same way, so she â€œgetsâ€ me and sheâ€™s been able to give lots of small and helpful suggestions that I can actually do. 

In her ideal world, people actively trying to lose weight would eat â€œlean and green.â€ Thatâ€™s protein in almost any lean form, unlimited green veggies, reasonable amounts of colorful non starchy veggies, limited amounts of nuts and healthy dairy, ONE serving of fruit each day, and very minimal added sugar. Like, aim for zero but realize thatâ€™s not always possible. 

Once you hit maintenance, youâ€™d gradually add in a second fruit serving, oatmeal, potatoes, brown rice, etc. But you never really reintroduce regular sweets. It doesnâ€™t need to be 100% abstinence but it shouldnâ€™t be a daily thing either. 

Relevant backstory: when I was younger (teens and early/mid twenties), I was a pretty prolific binge drinker. I wasnâ€™t a daily drinker, wasnâ€™t chemically dependent, etc but it was still a situation that wasnâ€™t ideal for physical or more importantly, mental health. And when you realize that the only thing youâ€™re looking forward to tomorrow is wine, itâ€™s a sign that youâ€™ve got an unhealthy relationship with wine going on. So I quit. I donâ€™t usually say â€œIâ€™m soberâ€ because I just... stopped drinking, I didnâ€™t really have this big recovery process, if that makes any sense. Iâ€™m not militant about it; Iâ€™ll eat food cooked in alcohol or even take a sip of champagne at a wedding. I just donâ€™t *drink* anymore. That said, Iâ€™m really grateful that I did stop. I know Iâ€™m in a much better place mentally and emotionally because of it. 

Iâ€™m not a binge eater but I very regularly eat sweets and baked goods. Iâ€™ve quit sugar short term but itâ€™s not easy. But Iâ€™m kind of wondering if itâ€™s something I need to do, like, forever. Itâ€™s not physically healthy and if weâ€™re being honest, if I have a brownie at home, Iâ€™ll look forward to it in the exact same way I would have looked forward to wine. Iâ€™m hesitant to say Iâ€™m â€œaddictedâ€ because Iâ€™m not having the same struggle as someone using heroin. But Iâ€™ve got an unhealthy relationship with sugar. 

Iâ€™m seriously considering this surgery and I know that itâ€™ll force me to quit sugar short term and I *should* significantly reduce sugar long term. I plan to be compliant, of course. But Iâ€™m also afraid of being years out and adding in sweets in moderation at first and then... not. It might be for me that I need to just give it up forever because itâ€™s got a very strong pull on me. And honestly, just contemplating it kind of makes me feel free in much the same way deciding to just stop moderating alcohol and put it down entirely did. 

Whatâ€™s your experience with sugar like? Iâ€™m interested in long before surgery, just before, post op, and years later, since I imagine itâ€™s probably evolved."
7 months post op - question on calorie intake.,"Iâ€™m 7 months post op and my results have been great 250lbs down to 176lbs (80kgs) with 10kgs more to go. 

Iâ€™m working out pretty regularly 4-5 times a week for 1hr averaging 600-700cals burnt per session but Iâ€™m constantly exhausted. My sleeping patterns are just screwed (currently sending this at 2:30am my time) and I think itâ€™s because my intake is too low for how much I work out. 

Iâ€™m currently eating 1400 cals per day, which is hard to hit due to my restriction so itâ€™s mostly made up of healthy small snacks through the day. Should I be eating more? 

I have my dietician follow up in a few weeks but wanted to get on top of this as Iâ€™m currently training for a marathon and want to increase my workouts before hand."
Decided to put some clothes on for this one. Feeeeeelin myself lately.,
Just wondering,I know they say itâ€™s a big no no but Iâ€™m wondering has anyone continued nicotine use after gastric bypass?? And if so have u had any problems??
Got a surgery date!,"I donâ€™t really have many people to tell in real life, so I thought Iâ€™d share my excitement with you guys. After six months of appointments, and three weeks of waiting for insurance approval, I finally heard back from my surgeonâ€™s office yesterday. Iâ€™ll be getting the gastric sleeve on September 6th. I bought all of my vitamins, protein drinks, and clear liquids immediately after the call. Iâ€™m feeling pretty prepared and confident, but Iâ€™m sure the anxiety will strike once the time gets closer."

Question, how long was the recovery time for many of you who had surgery? How many days did you stay home before going back to work? I chose a Wednesday surgery date because I figured Thurs-Sunday was a decent recovery time (2 day hospital stay + 3 days home) before going back to work.

Work is mostly at a desk and walking when I have mtgs in other buildings. Should I plan to take off additional days from work???"

4.5 years post op and looking for a way to kickstart the loss again,"As the title says, I'm 4.5 years post op having had my Sleeve done in November, 2014. I was nearly 400lbs when I had my wls and dropped to 248 at my lowest point in about May, 2015. I've since been SLOWLY creeping back up. I'm now sitting about 285 and have been holding here for a few months. With summer coming up, I REALLY want to kick-start the weight loss again and this time, try to get down to around 225. 

I assume my sleeve is stretched out right now because although I DO have restriction, it's nowhere near what it was back in the day. I can easily eat 2 pieces of pizza whereas before I could only eat maybe half a piece. Granted, prior to surgery, a full large pizza was the normal with no issue at all.

Has anyone here been successful at shrinking their sleeve back down to achieve the restriction we had in the beginning? If so, how did you do it?

I'd love to feel like I'm healthy again. "
Help! Dietitian trying to improve program,"Hi all, 
Iâ€™m a dietitian relatively new to weight loss surgery and have noticed some common patient complaints. Iâ€™m working with our team to revamp the nutrition component of our program to better suit patientâ€™s needs. 
I was hoping some of you could answer some questions for me..

1. What did you like about your pre-op nutrition appts?
2. What do you wish you learned in your pre-op appts?
3. What lifestyle components (eating out, exercise, holidays etc.) do you wish were addressed with your RD?
4. What support could you have used after surgery from your RD? 
5. Anything else? Please let me know! 

Thank you! "
My primary trigger for failing on a diet is being too busy. Is WLS still a good option?,"I can stick to a diet for about 4-5 months. I can do ok over the holidays, I can skip the donuts at work, and I can make good choices out with friends. But what inevitably happens is I end up in some sort of work emergency where Iâ€™ll be working 10-14 hours/day for a few weeks and my willpower just... isnâ€™t enough. 

I tried doing grocery delivery... even though itâ€™s expensive, I thought it might get me over the hump. But itâ€™s not just physical nourishment Iâ€™m needing in those times, I guess. Iâ€™m stretched so thin that I â€œneedâ€ fast food. By need, I mean I had been planning to be home for dinner when I left in the morning but now Iâ€™m going to be at work till 10pm and I have about 15 minutes to grab something to eat and thereâ€™s no grocery store nearby. I can get a salad for only so long in that situation before I break down and get a burger. Iâ€™m hungry, Iâ€™m under heaps of pressure, I resent the lack of control, and I just... break. 

I canâ€™t really scale back. Overall, I love my career. Iâ€™ll have these busy spurts 2-4 times a year ranging from 2-8 weeks at a time... probably a quarter to a third of the year (in total, not all at once) is hectic like that, and the rest of the time is much much lower key. Sometimes I know itâ€™s coming, and sometimes I donâ€™t. 

Iâ€™m a single mom to a teenager so while my life is a lot easier than it was when I was a single mom to a two year old, there are still a lot of balls in the air. Itâ€™s hard to keep that massage appointment or fit in exercise during those times. 

I guess Iâ€™m looking for two things: pragmatically, what can you keep on hand in your desk drawer at work for food emergencies? Itâ€™s not really practical to keep deli turkey that wonâ€™t usually get eaten. And on an emotional side, can I do this? Surely you werenâ€™t all laying around eating bonbons before surgery; I know we are all busy. Can anyone relate to failing at diets because they were overwhelmed and stretched too thin and resented the lack of control in their life? Is WLS still a good tool for me?"
"I can't stop losing weight, any advice?","TLDR: Can't stop losing weight no matter what or how often I consume. 2 years VSG post op.

Before I begin, no, I'm not trying to brag... I'm genuinely asking for help. 

I had gastric sleeve done a little over 2 years ago. My stomach and intestines around it hurt like crazy after surgery for months, but my surgeon wrote me off when I tried asking for advice to stop it. A year later, another surgeon perform emergency surgery to removal my gallbladder that was going into sepsis. In that year before hand, I had lost 200 lbs with no effort. I didn't have to work out or follow the diet as it was just falling off, I wrote this off to my age (22) and went on with my life and the pain until the gallbladder surgery needed to be done. After my gallbladder was removed, the new surgeon told me that my eating should start going back to normal portions and to be cautious of weight gain. He gave me my $8k bill and sent me out the door. 

Except it didn't... I kept losing. I keep losing. I bought my wedding dress 6 months ago when I thought I had stabilized and now I have to have it altered another 2 sizes down. When I was way under what I considered a good weight, I went on the WLS maintaining diet to stop. But the weight loss got faster, so I threw it out and started picking up anything I could find high calorie that I could swallow and I'm still dropping. 

I can't afford another surgeon visit, I can't eat more than 5 bites of food at a time, and I can't stop losing. Does anyone have any advice? I'm starting to look like Stephen King's thinner and I'm terrified. I'm saving up to go back, but I just can't afford it now that I've aged out of my mom's insurance. But I'm looking for something to help in the meantime. I'm beginning to get hopeless."

Did you take blood thinners before surgery?,"My surgeon requires it for BMIs over 50 and strongly recommends it for BMIs under 50. My BMI is 44 (and hopefully falling), Iâ€™m 40 years old, not on birth control, donâ€™t smoke, and I have no comorbidities. He explained that since Iâ€™m youngish, active, and healthy, my fall risk is low, so my risk of uncontrolled bleeding is low... but blood clots are more of an equal opportunity offender. Heâ€™s performed a lot of surgeries and said that he himself has never seen a person have uncontrolled bleeding, but he has seen people with blood clots, which is why heâ€™s so in favor of blood thinners. 

He did make sure to point out that he is more aggressive with recommending blood thinners in a patient like me than other surgeons might be, so I should do my own research and make sure Iâ€™m comfortable. 

What was your experience? Iâ€™m looking at sleeve, if that is relevant."

Question in Exercise,"SO I've started doing a Yoga program ( DDPY ) and while tracking my Calories something confusing has come up.

So if I have say 800 calories left for dinner, and I do a 30 minute work out and burn 400 Calories in it, I enter that into the app and it says I have 1200 calories left to go.... so wait.. am I suppose to eat more after working out or do I stick to the same amount? I don't have the typical after care support due to an argument with the Hospital after the surgery so I can't ask them. "

1. Who do I follow up with when Iâ€™m back in the US? What if I have complications?
2. Will I have drains?
3. How will I take my current medication? Do I need to speak to my US doctors in advance and get prescriptions for liquid forms?

5. Will I have a roommate if I travel alone? 
6. Am I guaranteed Dr. Ortiz if thatâ€™s who I ask for? If you have had Dr. Ortiz, how was your experience? 
7. Are any preventative measures taken to avoid gallstones? A surgeon I met with in the US (unfortunately insurance didnâ€™t work out) said that he gives some kind of shot.
8. How many nights in the hospital and how many nights in the hotel?
9. Did you feel safe?

Here and there Iâ€™ve been binging on peanut butter or cookies and it seems like my stomach is some kind of bottomless pit - the discomfort I had originally is dissipating.

If you havent seen any of my posts, im currently in the middle of an epic battle between my insurance, my provider and my employer for coverage to get RNY because my BMI is 48 and I have literally every common comorbidy you can think of. Long story short, im dying slowly but also faster than the average adult. 

My question is, how did you deal with the waiting before approval/denial? This battle has gone on for 3 months since Ive finished the program. I got the initial denial, which I expected and now i'm waiting for the appeal to come back. This part can take up to another 30 days. I've tried to distract myself as much as possible but when you're coming up on the one year mark of starting everything, you run out of distractions.

Gastric bypass -&gt; appendix -&gt; sleeve,"Just got sleeved on 5/29
SW:235 CW:220 GW:165

Anyways I originally planned on having the gastric bypass and I went in for that surgery on 5/22. During the surgery they found out I was not a candidate for the gastric bypass because I have a condition called mal rotation. So they took my appendix instead. Then schedule me for the sleeve surgery the next week.

I had a terrible time in recovery for the sleeve the first 24 hours I couldnâ€™t open my eyes and I was in a lot of pain. I originally was only going to do one night in the ER and ended up staying 2 nights. Plus they re opened my incisions from the appendix/gastric bypass removal. 

Anyways, now Iâ€™m home and am just trying to get my water and protein shakes in.

Iâ€™m still bummed I did not get gastric bypass.. but happy I have the sleeve still. Now I just want to recover so I can get back to work and on a routine.

Surgery today :),"Edit 2: Thanks so much for all the well wishes!

Edit 1: Update - Surgery went well. I feel ok. A little trouble taking in a breath. They said it was the TAP block (I think thatâ€™s what they called it) that numbs the area near the lungs. Iâ€™m also having a little gas bubble under the lowest ribs and in my left shoulder. This gets better each time I walk a lap around the ward - 4 so far! Theyâ€™ve been giving me extra strength Tylenol regularly and something for nausea. Otherwise no pain meds. 

Now the complaint, lol. The nurses and surgeon have all said to me they donâ€™t know much about Type 1 diabetes so they are going to treat me like Type 2. They wonâ€™t let me wear my insulin pump, so I have no background (basal) insulin at all. I also make none of my own, so every drop of insulin needs to come from an outside source.  They are letting me run very high then giving one bolus every 6 hours. BG that is over 300 feels crummy and slows healing. Also causes dehydration. Iâ€™m very disappointed in this part of the treatment. Iâ€™m going to push to go home tomorrow and am doing the 2 things they said were necessary to get there- using the incentive spirometer a lot and walking my a** off. ;)

I really hope everyone else having surgery today is progressing well too. :)

Iâ€™m a nervous wreck but have been scrolling through the sub and see so many positive experiences! I am 5â€™4, my HW was 231, CW (SW) is 213.  Im having the sleeve surgery around noon. 

I have Type 1 Diabetes and am wearing my CGM and pump site on the backs of my arms. No one could really tell me if that was ok or not. The surgeon just said not to put them anywhere on my stomach. Pre-op nurse yesterday said she had no idea, ask anesthesia. 

I was expecting to struggle with making sure my blood sugar didnâ€™t go low since they said no food or drinks after midnight; however, they now have you drink a 20 oz Gatorade G2 the morning of surgery. Itâ€™s nice to slowly sip on something, especially since Iâ€™m not scheduled until noon.

Fat Bottom Girls,"I'm sitting here at work and I can hear this Queen song playing back in the shop.  It takes me back to the parking lot of a college football stadium.  I was walking past the hordes of tailgaters enjoying the sun and excitement.   As I passed in front of a particularly lively tent, the song that was playing abruptly stopped and changed to this song instead.

I laughed it off but internally my spirit sank as I thought about how tight my companions were going to have to squeeze together to make up for how much room my fat bottom was going to take up on the bleachers with the tiny amount of room allotted by each seat number.

I don't know for sure that it was the exact moment I decided on WLS, but it is one that stands out for me as a reality check.

I am down 118 pounds today. I still have a fat bottom but its smaller than before and I still love this song.  My fat bottom is sexy at any weight, but I FEEL better.  I dont have to struggle to climb the bleachers. I can bend over and tie my shoes with my feet on the ground.  I can do a ton of things and it's awesome.

Dry/cracked bleeding hands over the past week. Vitamin deficiency?,"Title basically says it.

I can't tell if it's the cold (I live in the northeast US) or if I have some additional vitamin deficiency that is emerging now.

Am I the slowest loser ever?,"I had gastric bypass two weeks ago today. Iâ€™ve followed the program (water, protein, exercise) exactly as directed. As of this morning, I have only lost 8 pounds.  Based on all the wls stories Iâ€™ve read, it should be at least double or triple that loss by now. I started crying because Iâ€™m so disappointed and discouraged. I feel like Iâ€™m failing again at another diet. What am I doing wrong?? Any advice?? Thanks. 

Edit: Thanks for the replies and encouragement - y'all are great!  I'm ready to leave the pity party and move forward."
Does your program recommend counting calories?,"Hey guys, question is in the title. 

Last week, I had a group nutrition class, which was required for my program. I was pretty surprised that the dietician discouraged calorie counting. She recommended intuitive eating, 4-5 meals a day, writing down what we eat and how we feel, and estimating measurements.

Just wondering what other people do. If your program suggests one approach, do you follow it or do something else? Did it change before or after surgery?"

1 week VSG post op,"Down 17lbs from surgery morning, 30lb total and no longer super morbidly obese! Lots of pain in main incision site but back to many normal activities."
Sleepy/Exhausted,"Surgery 2/26 RNY since surgery Iâ€™ve had (this is the 2nd time I can recall) moments that Iâ€™m just completely wiped out. 

Iâ€™ll get home from work (4:30 central) and sleep till  7ish grab dinner (awake for about 45 minutes) and then sleep soundly till 6:15 the next day. Iâ€™ll have a few days like that and then one day Iâ€™ll just wake up normal and am not tired

Itâ€™s happened twice now and Iâ€™m curious if my body is just changing and the sleep is what Iâ€™m needing or if itâ€™s a lack of b12 or magnesium or the like?

Anyone else experience bouts of exhaustion after surgery ?"
RNY in 3 days (Thursday 6/20) and I'm freaking out. Distract me by helping me come up with cool ways to document my weight-loss journey?,"My surgery date was going to be in October or November, but an opening came up much sooner, and I took it. It is now on Thursday. 

(I had enough notice that I'll have been on a liquid diet for 2 weeks prior to surgery, I didn't just find out today)

I'm so excited for this next chapter of my life, and I'm extremely proud of my progress so far, even if it still feels like it would be nearly impossible to lose all the weight I want/need to on my own.

A year and a half ago, I weighed 580 lbs. One year ago, I weighed 546 lbs. Today, I weigh 486 (very nearly 100 lbs down in 1.5 years!) [Progress chart for this year](https://i.imgur.com/28UXPPS.png).

Losing this much weight so far, has been exceptionally difficult. When I'm not intermittent-fasting, which is most days, I'm staying around 1,800 calories, and &lt;30 grams of carbs. I'm also working out _hard_ for between 45m and 2-3 hours (basically until I can't move my arms or legs), 5 days per week. Some of what I've been doing is VR workouts, such as Beat Saber and BoxVR. If you can afford a VR setup, I strongly recommend it for a low-impact, high-intensity workout!

---

Anyway, I digress -- I'm here today, trying to distract myself. I've never had major surgery before. In fact, the only surgery I've ever had was to have my tonsils out, and I was too young to remember it. So I'm pretty scared.

I'm honestly not even afraid of anything like dying on the table, complications, or pain. The things that really fill me with terror, are  social or interpersonal things. Interacting with nurses. Not fitting on the bed. The possibility of not having a private recovery room. The medical gown not being large enough. Having to sleep in the hospital for a couple of nights...

Because of my weight, I've pretty much shunned almost all human contact for... pretty much my entire life. I've become pretty antisocial and introverted. Not agoraphobic, but I feel people looking at me as though it were a physical, viscerally terrible sensation. And I work from home, so I've become quite accustomed to having privacy.

So what I'd like to do, to take my mind off this fear, I'd like to think about cool ways to document my weight loss! 

I was thinking about maybe a photo every day? I've considered doing a video series on YT, but it'll be a long while before I look decent enough to want to be on camera. 

I also thought about recording myself now, saying the beginning of a sentence, then recording the end of the sentence in a year when I look radically different. That might be pretty funny. Or maybe a parody ""Thanos snap"" video where the video leading up to the snap is of me, now, and after the snap, cut to me  in a year, and saying ""I meant 50% of all PEOPLE, not 50% of EACH PERSON!"" :-P 

Do you folks have any ideas for fun ""transition"" videos or picture series', or other fun ways to document your weight loss?"
How long after laparoscopic VSG will I feel 100%?,"A bit surprised by how sensitive my stomach and wounds are so I want to re-set expectations. 

Had surgery Tuesday 3/19 and spent 1 night in the hospital. Able to get down ~500ml of liquids, but when will it stop being difficult? When will the soreness around my port wounds get better?

Am I okay to sleep on my frontside if I can position my weight comfortably?

Thanks yâ€™all "
Storing all the food,Do you guys have any recommendations on containers that are good to store smaller portions? Every time I eat things I can only finish a small portion and then have no good way to store the leftovers. It'd be nice if they were marked 1/2 cup or similar too. It would really help for when I get back to work.
Looking for some different perspectives.,"I'm just looking for someone 6 months out, a year out, 2 years out, maybe ten years out of surgery to give me their perspective on the surgery, weight loss, life after surgery. Your body, your diet, your relationships, working out, shopping. Maybe it's a lot to ask! 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about 2 months out now and it's been... I don't want to over exaggerate but it's been pretty awful for me. I posted previously explaining what I was going through, but the TLDR is that I developed some scar tissue pretty early on, couldn't eat, and was basically on a liquid diet for about 6 weeks. I was tired and lethargic the whole time and just kind of miserable until the surgeon finally did an endoscopy with dilation and fixed the issue. Since, I still find that some foods upset my stomach and can make me vomit in 1-2 bites. Some foods cause me a lot of discomfort and pain. I am still very gassy, even two months after surgery and still get some pains in my stomach when I lay on my side.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not trying to be a baby or wuss about it, I just want to hear people tell me it gets better. Or hell, maybe not. Be real with me here. I like it when you're realistic.

&amp;#x200B;

My surgery was November 26th, I started this whole journey back in April when I first learned I needed 6 months/visits with a dietician. My starting weight was 397. Weight at surgery was 378. Current weight is 333lbs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I losing at a slow rate? How fast did you lose? I went on a stall for about 10 days, unfortunately. 

How did your relationships change? My boyfriend right now is supportive, but I wonder if my weight loss is going to change his attitude. I've heard a lot about relationships changing after WLS.

Did working out change for you? Do you do anything differently than before surgery?

How do you feel in your skin now? Do you have a lot of loose skin? 

Were you forced to stop eating certain foods entirely? Do you ever have ""guilty"" snacks/pleasures? How many calories do you consume at your point post-op?

Is there something you know now, that you wish you had known at 2 months out of surgery?

&amp;#x200B;

Anything you care to tell me, I'd love to hear. Thank you. "
"I am so damn sick of the ""accidentally ate something"" dreams","They are slowly replacing the ""realize I'm naked in public"" and ""didnt study for this test"" dreams. I'm having them every few days now. Today I accidentally drank a coke, a few days ago I ate some kind of cookie buffet... I wouldn't mind it so much except I wake up thinking it's real for a few minutes and being pissed at myself for screwing up. Does it get better?"
"Every day that passes I think, ""if the hair loss stops today I'll still look fine"", but of course it doesn't. How long does this last?",I'm five months out and it's finally becoming a problem. I've been losing for about a month but I have (had...) a metric fuckton of hair and I just started actually seeing it on my head this week. My husband is six months out and claims his is slowing down. Is that about when it slowed down for everyone else?
Update: Day four post-op,"I was informed and comforted by so many posts during my long pre-op so I thought I would post my experience in case it helps ease anyone elseâ€™s worry. 

My VGS was on May 28, 2019. SW was 213. Iâ€™m 5â€™4.5â€ tall. I have Type 1 diabetes and an empty nest, just me and my husband.

I can honestly say that the worry and stress I created for myself were far worse than anything related to the actual surgery.  I was able to come home the evening of the 29th. My â€œjobâ€ since then has been to sip water, get 3 protein drinks down every day, chew gum 3 times a day, walk, and use the incentive spirometer every hour that Iâ€™m awake. 

Iâ€™ve had no gas pain at all.  Thereâ€™s massive discomfort in my abdomen when trying to get up unassisted from sitting or lying down and only a bit of stinging pain where the incisions are stapled.  The getting up thing is the hardest to deal with. Itâ€™s like thereâ€™s zero core strength. I donâ€™t think I could have done without my husband here that first day home. Fortunately, each day, it has become easier and now I just push down hard on the chair arms or bed and lift myself-still uncomfortable, but doable.  Coughing and sneezing still hurt a lot though.

Iâ€™m already tired of my protein shakes, lol. It doesnâ€™t help that I subscribed to many Keto recipe subs during the pre-op diet, and those food pics keep scrolling by. I havenâ€™t yet lost the hunger feeling but have been assured by my surgeon that it will happen in the next few days. So, my stomach is growling and Iâ€™m fighting hunger pretty much whenever Iâ€™m awake. 

No matter how much I tried to get in the habit of slowly sipping before surgery, I still take a big drink occasionally and boy do I pay for it. Thereâ€™s a huge pressure that happens immediately in my chest and I feel like itâ€™s squeezing my lungs shut. Iâ€™m doing much better at sipping now. :)

I try listening to my body. I nap when I feel sleepy, sit quietly and read most of the rest of the time. Iâ€™ve had no visitors (at my request) since a very short visit from one of my kids the first day home. Iâ€™m a smother mother and would try to feed or take care of anyone showing up, so itâ€™s better to let that wait a while.

Itâ€™s been a bit tricky figuring out new insulin dosages, but I have a pump and CGM that provide enough information that I have managed to not have more than a couple of low readings. I froze some grape juice in 2 oz popsicles before going to the hospital and have used these to correct lows. Otherwise, my BG has stayed pretty steady between 70-95. I got to stop my blood pressure med in the hospital because my BP was measuring lower than they wanted. Yeah, one medicine gone!

Iâ€™m taking the super Tylenol they gave me because I am a big baby and canâ€™t handle much pain. I do think though that I would probably be ok without it.

Helpful hints: wear soft cotton shirts that donâ€™t rub the incisions, have a small travel pillow that you can press against your belly while getting up, sitting down, and even walking the first few days, ladies who have given birth - remember the fast whoo whoo breathing? that has really helped when the pain or discomfort arrives. 

Thatâ€™s probably enough rambling from me. Iâ€™m happy to answer any questions. :)"
Travel a month after WLS?,Hiya there! I'll be having my VSG on the 23rd of June and I just got an invitation to come visit my close friend at the end of July/beginning of August. The travel would involve a pretty quick flight that doesn't really concern me but it would also involve figuring my new dietary restrictions out in a completely new environment just a month after my operation. I'm wondering if it's a good idea to go or would you guys advise me to stay home in a more stable environment?
Gallbladder removal,Iâ€™m 7 days shy of my 1 year surgiversary and have to go have my gallbladder out today. My surgeon said itâ€™s very very common after wls. He said it will feel basically the same as the sleeve did with the same recovery time and plan. Feeling sort of like deja vu getting ready to go to the hospital this morning. Lol 
Anyone else with the sleeve get dumping syndrome?,"3 and a half weeks out from surgery. I just had some canned pineapple in my protein shake to try and spice things up, and 10 minutes later my heart was racing, I had horrible abdominal cramps and then evacuated the protein shake and everything else out of my rear end.

I had fresh pineapple ladt week with no issues but the canned pineapple felt like it damn near killed me.

Not fun. Wont be adding canned pineapple to my protein anymore. 


Anyone else with the sleeve get dumping like this?"
People with Kaiser insurance - what did your pre-surgery timeline look like?,"My doc (who had previously been unwilling to refer me to the program) has now referred me, after writing her a very convincing email.

She said that the process will take anywhere from 6-9 months, and that Iâ€™ll need to:
1. Meet with the bariatric nutritionist for a â€œscreeningâ€ to see if the program is a good fit for me
2. Get tested for sleep apnea
3. 6 months of nutritionist-guided weight loss and lifestyle modifications
4. Lose 5-10% of my body weight

I have an appointment with the bariatric nutritionist on Thursday.  Does anyone know what I should expect? 

Also, Iâ€™m pretty sure Kaiser requires you to prove youâ€™ve been overweight for a long time and that youâ€™ve tried to diet before.

Although I have tried to diet before (each time losing anywhere from 20-70 lbs), Iâ€™ve never done a medically supervised diet. I have done Atkins, IF, and CICO, but ultimately gained all the weight back. Do you think the fact that Iâ€™ve done these diets on my own instead of being medically supervised will affect my eligibility?"
Starting the journey,"I posted a while ago on here stating that I was contemplating weight loss surgery. I received very positive comments so thanks again!! I canceled my initial appointment with my PCP because i was scared of rejection but I finally had the guts to go to the appointment and I got the referral to see a surgeon!! Within a week or so, I should be able to be able to schedule an appointment with a surgeon (for their next available appointment of course) !!! Iâ€™m so excited and nervous and optimistic to start this journey!!! Please send love and positive thoughts my way that I can get an appointment with a good surgeon soon.

Life Update: I Have Arthritis or A Really Bad Infection or Both.,"Help. 
So I have been on this site about my random pains and stuff going on with my body before since I lost weight. Now I'm 100 lbs down, yay, but my pain has increased. 

My new primary called with results to my SED rate lab tests. My C Reactive and my wbc is high. Nurse said doctors confirmed that its arthritis but they want to retest the wbc to be sure its not some random  infection. 

She said he'd discuss more in **our appointment in February** (anyone see why I am freaking out now?) 

Anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any encouraging words? I went on a walk to try to calm myself down so I wouldn't have a panic attack but now I am sitting and typing this, I might have a panic attack. 

Help?

What do you know about the risks of long-term gastric bypass surgery?,"Hello friends. I want to have a gastric bypass surgery. I've been thinking about this for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

I know they have risks. But I think I can't lose weight any more. He had short and long term risks. According to what I [read here](https://www.theweightlosssurgery.com/gastric-bypass-surgery-risks/); I did not like the long-term risks.

&amp;#x200B;

**They say;**

* Gallstones which can be removed by surgery.
* Low blood sugar
* Bowel obstructions, also known as hernia.
* Change in bowel functions, sometimes you will be having diarrhea.
* Stomach perforation
* Mental health problems
* Ulcers might develop

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think I can get through this surgery without any problems?"
Lactose Intolerance?,"So, I had the surgery going on two months ago (and finally losing again after like a month and a half stall!) Before and directly after I was able to handle dairy products just fine. I drank Premier shakes for my protein and those are dairy based. Well I haven't had any in like a month so I decided to try to have one to increase my protein. I got so freaking sick, oh my god. I thought I was going to actually vomit. That passed finally but the problem had just traveled to the back end, if you get my drift. So, I'm thinking maybe it was just bad timing and I was getting sick anyway. Wait a few days, try again. Same exact thing. Has anyone else experienced suddenly becoming lactose intolerant out of nowhere? It's really really annoying!!"

I'm set for snacks for now (yogurt, cottage cheese, cheese sticks). 

Thanks!"
Two Weeks Post Surgery - Feeling Poorly,"Hi - this is my first post and my first attempt to find some support for my new lifestyle.    Iâ€™ve been feeling really down and wanted to just share.   Iâ€™m sure none of this is uncommon

Itâ€™s been a little rough but I suppose anytime you have something so invasive done thereâ€™s going to be some trauma in there.

The biggest challenge for me so far has just been a general sense of physical malaise.  It kinda feels like I have a very mild case of the flu all the time.  Ive even had a couple of days with a mild fever. 

No nausea or vomiting but my digestive tract always feels a little queasy like I used to get if I had gone a long time without food.

Iâ€™m still on liquids (protein drinks) and soup.  Also some yogurt.  I canâ€™t have any lumps or chunks but next week I can reintroduce some machined or processed food.  Like applesauce consistency.  Iâ€™m scared to do this though.   Right now I have no appetite and have to force myself to do the protein drinks and yogurt so I still get my protein.

Iâ€™m getting around 450 calories a day which might be one of the reasons Iâ€™m feeling lethargic and unsettled.

Iâ€™m also having trouble getting in my water.  40 oz a day has been a real task and I know Iâ€™m supposed to have more.   It seems like Iâ€™m constantly drinking, either water or a protein shake.   

Maybe the lack of water has triggered a mild bladder infection because I know I have to go more frequently and urgently than before.  Could be thatâ€™s related to the mild fever.

My doctor kinda scared me with what the future holds as far as diet.  In my first consultation, when he reviewed what was ahead, he told me that I would have to eliminate all sugar, forever, even fruit juice.  Essentially Iâ€™m looking at a few ounces of lean protein, some cooked vegetables and a little starch.  Nothing processed and very little fat.

I kinda joked with him and said â€œIf I could have stuck with that diet, I wouldnâ€™t need surgeryâ€. He basically said that my body would force it on me because of dumping syndrome if I ate sugar or processed foods.   Iâ€™m still fuzzy on all that but Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll find out.  I asked the nutritionist that I saw as part of preop if I would ever enjoy food again and she said â€œno, not really.  Not like you do now.â€

So, as I look forward Iâ€™m mentally a little daunted, imagining a tiny plate with a couple of ounces of boiled chicken, a half cup of cooked spinach and a spoonful of potatoes for the rest of my life.  Iâ€™m exaggerating, I know.

My wife and I donâ€™t really cook but it seems like weâ€™ll have to start if I want to find some variety and flavor.

Obviously, you donâ€™t spend 40 years as an overweight, and then obese, person without having a ton of mental hangups with food and Iâ€™m sure that will be the biggest challenge life all.

Anyway, thatâ€™s what I came here to say.   Just feeling a bit sorry for myself and fighting against thoughts of â€œwhat if this sense of constant mild  illness is my new normal?â€  Surely not but itâ€™s been two weeks and while my incisions and muscles feel much better, my general sense of wellness continues to be poor.

Thanks for reading"

This is the moment to keep control. I hope I can.,"The danger after surgery are the moments where something bad happens.   
Something bad just happened to me.   
I was looking for a job and 3 weeks ago I found one. Not great but money was right. I was desperate and this saved my behind. The last 2 weeks were tough when it came to diets (and the job). I stayed in an Airbnb without a kitchen so I had a protein bar for breakfast and lunch and Panda Express for Dinner. Panda Express has several lower calorie options with protein and vegetables as a side. There was no other fast food I could think of except maybe El Pollo Loco.

Today I returned to work after a short weekend to start my third week and I was fired. I am so depressed and sad and panicked that I am thinking about food all day. I so want to dive into a pile of burgers till I burst. Of course I will not, but these are the times where everything can turn to the bad. Where People loose control and start to regain.

I am writing this to tell the story and to tell myself to stay on track. Writing it down helps."
How long after VSG am I allowed to try to eat nuts again?,One of my favorite high-protein snacks has always been nuts.  I can't find on my packet given to me by my surgeon when I am allowed to try nuts again.  Any ideas?
Pretty stupid question but bare with me,"I know that you arenâ€™t supposed to drink liquids and be eating at the same time , but what about soups that have chunky bits of vegetable , meat , etc ? What about having tea and biscuits ?"
Sleeved on June 12. Currently struggling.,"Itâ€™s been nearly two months since i was sleeved and for a while i was doing really well. I was consistently losing weight and feeling well and was able to eat most things. For about a week now though iâ€™ve been consistently nauseated and usually begin my day dry heaving. Sometimes itâ€™ll just happen in the morning and sometimes itâ€™ll happen 2 or 3 times a day. Eating is a chore now and i have a hard time even drinking one bottle of water per day. Certain smells will make me sick and i canâ€™t stand to even think about eating. I also havenâ€™t been having regular bowel movements. Itâ€™s been 4 days since my last one and even then it was aided by linzess. 

Iâ€™m thinking itâ€™s because of a nasal drip that i have at the moment but iâ€™m worried at the same time that something more serious is wrong. Does anyone else have a similar experience or possibly some insight as to what could be going on?"

Success and self-sabotage?,"Hi, all. First off, I wanna say that I've been lurking here for a while now, and you're all quite the inspiration, and I aspire someday to have before and after photos that I can be proud of. This post might be a bit rambly, but it's the best way I know how to communicate.

What follows is a LOT of background info, because I feel the need to vent, but you can skip to the \*\*\* below if you want to get right to the point of this post. I won't call it a TL;DR, because even that is pretty long. :P

I'm a 34 year old male living alone in Northern Illinois. I'm 5' 10"". Highest weight: 380 lbs. Current weight: 322 lbs. I had my initial consultation with a bariatric treatment center on October 1st, almost 4 months ago, when my work insurance changed, and I suddenly found myself eligible for it. I have *not* had any surgery so far. My final two (of six) monthly visits with the dietician are scheduled for February 20th and March 20th of this year, and then we can look at surgical dates.

My mother had a gastric bypass roughly 20 years ago, and had a lot of success, losing a tremendous amount of weight, and she became much healthier. After my father died in 2004, she resorted to alcohol to cope with her grief, and has struggled with that, and her weight, since. These days, the alcoholism is mostly in check, and as far as living with an RNY 20 years on, she certainly doesn't ""play by the rules."" She drinks soda (and when she can get away with it, wine), eats sweets and fatty foods, doesn't take any vitamins, doesn't exercise at all, and doesn't do anything that you're supposed to do after the surgery. She did for a while, but doesn't any more. She eats just like your average Jane, just smaller portions. She's gained some weight back for sure, but sheâ€™s absolutely nowhere near where she used to be. She's almost 70 years old now, so I don't harass her about it, because at her age, she's earned the right to do whatever she damn well pleases.

A few years after my mom had her surgery, she actually became employed at the bariatric center where she had her operation. She became close with a lot of the staff, and a surgeon or two, and when I was 17 (and already very obese), she encouraged me to come to the center and have a consultation, which I did. I honestly remember almost nothing about the visit, except that when I was told I'd need to consult with a psychologist, my teenage pride got the better of me, and I blew my chance at a very young gastric bypass, by refusing to see one. ""THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH MAH BRAIN, I DON'T NEED TO SEE NO STINKIN' SHRINK."" Now I'm older, wiser, and know that there's plenty (!) wrong with me, and I should've been seeing a therapist all my life. And I did, for the first time, On January 9th. It was a mostly painless visit, though opening up to a complete stranger was quite uncomfortable (except on Reddit of course). I even let her talk me into an additional visit to talk about stress management and social anxieties - go me.

When I had my initial consultation on October 1st (which just so happens to be my birthday), I was SO on board. I went all out. I understood everything I was getting into - my mom's experience and encouragement being a useful resource. I understood that, among all the prerequisites for surgery, one of the most important was that - under no circumstances - was I to weigh more at the final dietician visit than I did on the initial consultation. No matter what else happens, I cannot weigh a fraction of a pound over 380 on March 20th. Or I'm out. I'm also required to keep a food and exercise journal for the entire six month duration, which, along with reviewing with the dietician, will be submitted to my insurance before approval. But, like I said, I was all in. I got back on MyFitnessPal (which I'd come and gone from dozens of times over the years), and weighed and tracked every morsel that found its way into my mouth. I hadn't joined a gym yet, but I bookmarked 7 or 8 workout videos on YouTube, and bought a set of resistance bands for home. I gave up soda (my weakness) and fast food. My journal was 100% truthful and accurate, and well below my daily calorie requirements, despite some minor struggles with carbohydrates and sugar. I was exercising (and hating it) 3-4 times a week, and I was cooking more! I was trying all kinds of new recipes, some of which were amazing (Turkey-veggie meatloaf cups), and some of which were heinous (Chickpea sandwich filling). I hate cooking. I really do. I'm bad at it, I inevitably make a gigantic fucking mess, I'm lazy, I want the instant gratification of quick meals, and I draw out the process far too long because I'm anal about measurements, precision, and presentation, even when Iâ€™m the only one eating or even seeing it. But shit, I was doing it; and rockin' it. At my first dietician visit after the consultation, I'd already lost 35 lbs, and was further motivated by the astonishment and encouragement she showed me. She even asked ""...are you eating?"" It felt good.

\*\*\* This trend of success had continued for 3 months. After a while, it felt like the YouTube videos I was exercising to were too simple, and that I was kind of phoning it in. So I buckled down and joined a gym near my apartment. Now I was really working out, pushing myself, and feeling amazing. I invited coworkers and friends to come along (though, to this day, I've had no takers). I've had people notice the changes in my face, and in my energy level. This too, felt amazing. I've kept up with every single appointment that I'm required to have. I had a cardiac stress test. I had a sleep study done (I'm still trying to make friends with my CPAP...). I had an ultrasound on my gallbladder. I saw the psych. I'm still in this, and I'm trying my damnedest, but...

I'm struggling right now. I've lost 58 lbs since October 1st, and the past week or two has seen me fall back into old habits... and I've gotten lazier with cooking... I still hate it. I've had some fast food meals... big ones. Two nights ago, I killed an entire 18 inch pizza in one sitting... with breadsticks. Three nights before that, I ordered Chinese... had sweet and sour chicken... and a beef teriyaki appetizer... and egg rolls... eight of them. I've had a couple cans of soda... I've caught myself grazing in the fridge (this isn't as bad as the others though, because I'm still only buying wholesome groceries... midnight snacking on sugar snap peas probably isn't going to be the death of me.)

All these failures are being documented in my food journal (as accurately as I can, anyway), and I'm afraid of what this means for me. Every time I do something like this, I find myself ""recommitting"" to doing better, but what good is that if I un-commit just because I caught a whiff of deep-fried-sugar-dusted-chocolate-drizzled-butter-soaked-thick-cut bacon skewers (not a real thing, I hope)?  
   
 

I know what my triggers are. Stress, boredom, loneliness, anxiety. I'm coping with these things much better now than I have ever in my life, but the added stress of committing to dietary changes for this kind of duration is kicking my ass lately...

I have a few questions:

1. Those of you who have had WLS, and had to go through some sort of monitored diet program prior, how often did you      ""cheat?"" How did you get back on track? Were you honest about these infractions? 
2. After surgery, I understand all the things that will be encouraged and discouraged, but just as I've personally never known a diabetic to not sneak a soda or a slice of cake, how have you coped so far with ""breaking the rules"" after surgery? 
3. If I talk with my dietician about this, I don't want to run the risk of a warning (we get three, then we're out of the program). How can I discuss this as an acknowledgement of my weaknesses, and seek the guidance I need, without risking a setback in my program? 
4. For the love of god, I don't want to be like this... I want to be like I was in October, absolutely committed and focused on the target. How do I get back there without going insane? 
5. Is this something I should discuss with my psych instead of the dietician? Or should I talk to both of them? Or, is this      just an extinction burst that I'll get over, and I shouldn't risk the setback?

I could go on for hours, but this is long enough already, and my fingers are cold because it's January in Northern Illinois and I'm a fat guy who runs hot and doesn't like to turn the heat on... haha... Thanks for listening."

"Surgery scheduled, 9/9/19.l; have some questions","Hey all, long time reader, first time poster in this sub. 

Since I donâ€™t have flair, I will add my details here: M/32, 6â€™4â€, HW: 361, CW: 353, GW: 250, 9/9/19 VSG 

I had my pre-surgery appointment with my surgeon today, and am in the miserable midst of a 2 week pre-op diet. I am going VSG, and just had a few questions for those of you who have had it done. 

How long after surgery until you felt hungry? I have heard vastly different timeframes and am terrified I will have the surgery and forever feel miserably hungry like I do on this diet. 

Was fatigue a significant issue? If so, how long did it last? have two kiddos under 3 who I eagerly want to get back to playing with. 

My surgeon wants me to use an antacid for 3 months post surgery, and mentioned that long term reflux may be a side effect of the sleeve. Is this common?

Lastly, I work in law enforcement and am terrified that I will have issues eating properly and regularly while being primarily in my patrol car. For those of you that are on the go, how have you adapted to make sure you stay on plan? 

Thanks in advance!"

here's my issue... i can't help but compare my weight loss to others.  scrolling through this group i found two women who had similar starting weights but have dropped at least 20 more lbs than myself in about the same amount of time.

logically i know it's not reasonable, but i need some barometer for where i should be now. how much have you all lost in your first 3-4 mos?"
Daily protein goal?,"So I had an RNY Bypass 5 weeks ago, and the aftercare where I'm from is pretty poor.

I kind of feel like I was given the op and then sent off on my own to just get on with it.
I was told I'd have a 6 week check, but they sent me a letter for a check at FOUR MONTHS cause they're busy. I complained and got it reduced to 10 weeks..

There isn't a specific nurse or dietician for for me to contact so hoping you guys might be able to help. I'm not very trusting of Dr Google!

I know I'm meant to favour protein now, but no one has actually told me how many g/day I should be aiming for at this stage and beyond.

I also have no idea if I should be trying to stick within a certain calorie range.

Any advice?

"
Feel like I'm eating to much at meals,"I'm 3 weeks out from RNY. I've had no big complications and its been pretty smooth sailing. But I feel like I can eat more than I should be at this stage, I'm currently in soft foods and I have 1 30g protein drink and 3 ~20g protein meals a day.

 I can eat 2 eggs with salsa, a cheese stick and like 1/4 cup of asparagus w/ dressing or another meal is a whole yogurt 5.3 oz and a cheese stick or 3oz chicken and mayo, cheese stick and 1/4cup beats w/ dressing. 

I asked my nutritionist and she said to eat until satisfied but I'm not really physically hungry just head hungery so I feel like when I do I eat to much. I know that I eat to fast and am trying to work on that with a timer so that I have a pause between bites. I'm not having a problem getting almost 90g of protein and I'm always between 48-64oz of fluid.

How much were you eating at this stage?
And did it change when you were on a normal all textures diet?

I need advice.," 

Hi, my name is Brittany and im 25 years old.

Iâ€™ve been overweight my whole life. My weight increases every year no matter what or how hard I try to combat it. I am now medically considered morbidly obese with a BMI of 52.Â 

At age 14 I was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. It affects every part of my body. My ability to lose weight, my insulin resistance, my menstrual cycle, it even causes some of my hair to fall out every few months. And my weight just makes it worse. Itâ€™s like I canâ€™t win for losing. I diet and exercise an obsessive amount only to lose 5lbs and then gain 10 more. Hereâ€™s a link to learn more: [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pcos/symptoms-causes/syc-20353439](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pcos/symptoms-causes/syc-20353439)

My weight has started to affect my mental and physical health drastically as of late. Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder, depression, fatty liver disease, Type 2 diabetes and hypertension along with my PCOS. I canâ€™t do things that I used to, my range of motion has started to go down along with my stamina and energy levels. Also I have to get regular liver and kidney treatments to keep them working correctly while I am this heavy. All of this compiled into one huge storm that I canâ€™t seem to weather. But with your help I can get the surgery that I need to help me get back to myself. So that I can be healthy. Mentally and physically.Â 

Every doctor that I have been to in the last three years has urged me to seek out Gastric bypass. This February I finally got the courage up to make an appointment only to find out months (and 8 copays) later that my insurance does not cover it. Even though I have 5 specialists that say it is medically necessary.Â 

I was crushed when my insurance denied me and I'm looking for advice on what I should do from here. I have no family and I just feel so alone with all of this medical stuff piling up.

Please feel free to shoot me a message here or even email me at [bdtknd@gmail.com](mailto:bdtknd@gmail.com)

Thank you so much in advance for your help &lt;3"
Recovery time question,"Hello, I've got a question for those who've had the VSG.  My surgery is scheduled for March 28, and there is a show that I really really really want to go to on 4/2.  It's a comedy show.  So - comedy show, where laughing is pretty much going to happen, the evening of my fifth day after surgery.  

Is this a possibility or should I forget about it because I'll be too fatigued or in pain?  I generally bounce back from things fast if that helps. "

Question about soup..,"Okay, so, just looking into wls, &amp; actually going to talk to my PCP about it Friday. Theyâ€™ve mentioned it to me over the last few years. I ALWAYS have said totally off the table (probably because of the stigma around it &amp; my extreme fear of surgery, but emergency c-section last year, felt the first cut before being knocked out &amp; now Iâ€™m, apparently, fearless. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½â€â™€ï¸); however, Iâ€™ve recently been researching and decided it would be the best option for me. 

My actual question, though, is soup is like ALWAYS a biggie or recommended that I can tell. BUT, if you arenâ€™t supposed to eat and drink at the same time (from what Iâ€™ve read because the liquid washes the food down and you lose nutrients, etc...); then, how can soup be a good thing. Serious question and just curious. Thanks guys!"

What If I Eat Too Little?,"I am 3 weeks and 3 days post-op RNY. My program has us eating real foods after week 1 and I have been doing great. That  is until I encountered one of the most horrific personal situations you can imagine. Out of the blue and after 20 years, my husband said he wants a divorce. I am an emotional wreck and I am struggling to eat. I am also low on water and crying a lot. I am taking all.my vitamins. Most days I am still getting my 65g of protein. My calories seem really low (under 500 calories). Today I barely got 37 grams of protein and 348 calories. I am trying to work on my mental state, but what are the ramifications of eating like this? Is there such a thing as too few calories? My program doesn't have us count them."

I got my date!!!!,"I was expecting closer to mid-September but I got the call today and I'm scheduled for 8/27!!! I'm straight bugging!! I start my pre-op liquid diet tomorrow. I haven't even bought the shakes I need yet! AH!

I have a dinner and movie date tonight. Sushi followed by popcorn. I will have to enjoy them because it's going to be a long time before they'll touch my lips again. The sushi isn't a big deal, I prefer sashimi anyway.. but popcorn has always been one of my favorite treats.

If I'm feeling up to it during the pre-op diet, I think I might try to go to the gym while my husband makes and consumes his dinner. (This sounds like a great plan... we'll see.)

I have one appointment with my surgeon, blood work, paperwork for leave from work, one mandatory pre-op class... and then.. that's it. I finish my pre-op diet and then it's time to do the thing!

I feel like I should be doing more to prepare but what else is there!? :)"

I am hoping I'll settle down a bit once I'm actually at the hospital and things are moving along. For now I'm gonna lie in bed sleepless, try to quietly watch something on my phone so I dont wake up my husband and wait for the alarm to go off in a little over an hour. I do wanna thank those of you who have answered my questions in the past, and helped make it possible for me to be where I am at today. I hope one day soon I can post some killer progress pics!

I walked around the store about 4 times before stopping in the middle of an aisle and nearly had a nervous breakdown because I couldn't find anything that didn't have pasta or rice or some other starch. It sucks not being able to just grab something and go.  

I wound up buying some sliced turkey breast and came home and made a wrap.

Questions about surgery,"Hello everyone.  So I am looking into getting gastric sleeve done at the recommendation of my Dr. I contacted the center he directed me towards and it turns out my insurance wonâ€™t cover any of it.

"My visit at a ""Destination XL"" store yesterday","Hello All... Thought I tell you about my visit at the DXL store yesterday.

I needed a new nice shirt since I am about to apply for new jobs. I have not bought a shirt in a long time and had no idea what size I am right now (apart from 2XL). Turns out I am a 18.5 neck shirt. I was so happy. I used to be over a 22. That made me happy. When I almost jumped up when he told me... The sales guy asked why I am so happy. I told him I lost 100 lbs and that that measurement amazed me. His eyes went wide and he (big fellow himself) asked me how I did it. I told him ""surgery"". 

He asked all kind of questions. None of them negative. Other customers came over cause they overheard us talking so we became a little group of 5 people and I told them what I did, how the pain was, what the procedure was and that my insurance paid... 2 of the guys said they will contact their insurance to see if it is covered. I told them that they have plenty of time, that the whole thing would take 6 month or longer from first visit to surgery and that gives them enough time to study up and think about it. One guy said he had pain in his legs (joints) and could not exercise and I told him that I ate ibuprofen like candy before surgery and after I had maybe a handful of Tylenol in the last 9 month.

I am just telling this story to show that there is a ""hunger"" out there for this and misinformation prevents many people from pursuing this. And to show that the reaction is NOT a negative one when you tell people. The opposite is true most of the time. "

Did anyone NOT lose anything during the six month physician supervised diet?,"My insurance requires a six month physician supervised diet which I started in October. My six month appointment is March 29th and I haven't lost a pound. I've definitely changed my habits as far as physical exercise - I walk 30 mins/day and joined a gym that I go to 3x a week. There I do strength training and cardio. I've been eating better but I will fully admit that I've been having some food funerals. 

Did anyone else not lose anything?  They told me I'm fine as long as I don't gain anything but I kind of feel like a failure :("
Was anyone diagnosed with sleep apnea before surgery?,"I havenâ€™t even started the wls program â€œfor realâ€ yet. I have my first meeting with the bariatric surgeon on Thursday to determine my eligibility. But my pcp already scheduled me for an at home sleep study, and the results came back today that I apparently have mild sleep apnea.

Iâ€™m having a really hard time dealing with this. I know I have really bad nasal congestion all the time, but I never knew it was stopping my breathing at night. Iâ€™m also a little skeptical of the test because the sensor literally shocked me out of my sleep at one point and left a burn on my finger, so Iâ€™m pretty sure it was malfunctioning because I was told itâ€™s not supposed to do that. 

Anyways, to qualify for surgery, I now have to wear a CPAP machine on my face all night, which means I have to sleep on my back (which I NEVER do and it is so uncomfortable for me because I have such a big butt). I have to have 75% compliance to get the surgery. 

Iâ€™m so angry and lost. Iâ€™m too young for this. I hate this. Iâ€™m praying that the apnea is resolved once I lose the weight, but I doubt it will be because itâ€™s obstructive sleep apnea caused by my constant congestion due to allergies."
Has anyone -not- done low carb post surgery and still lost weight?,"Hi, 

I am 9 weeks post op and really struggling at the moment with eating.

I currently cannot eat eggs, red meat, pork, soy, artificial sugars, fats, green vegetables, tomatoes without getting pain or indigestion.

My stomach seems to handle chicken in small quantities, beans, cheese, and funnily enough - carby foods like oats, crackers, potatoes, beans, lentils, biscuits etc. 

Eating dry biscuits seems to be the only thing that doesn't hurt at all. 

Everyone on forums etc say I should be doing keto/low carb right now but I have no idea how to eat low carb when most protein and fat literally starts making me throw up. My dietitian hasn't told me to do low carb though, she just said get 60gms of protein a day.

I'm putting collagen protein in my morning cup of tea but that's only 11gms of protein.

So my question: has anyone lost weight without cutting carbs to under 50gms a day? Am I doomed? 

Also I'd love to hear suggestions of what you are all eating."
Bariatric RD/CDE Looking for Patient Perspective,"Hi all,  

I have been a Bariatric RD/CDE for 4 years now and LOVE it. I work along side the bariatric surgeon, bariatrician (focuses on medical weight management), NPs, psychologist, etc.   I am always wanting to grow as a dietitian and was wanting to know if anyone had advice for the medical professional working along side your journeys!

I congratulate all your hard work, especially since bariatric surgery is most definitely not the ""easy way out"".  My patients work so hard to get to surgery and to succeed after surgery!

Thanks in advance!

"Flying home from WLS in Tijuana, thoughts and my must have list.","So I'm currently on the plane, returning home after having my surgery in Mexico on Monday. I had a sleeve 8 years ago and was marginally successful. Statistically average as it turns out. I was 320 or so at my highest, and lost at the most 60% of my excess weight, and that was kind of it. I decided that I did want to lose the rest and that I needed the malabsorption that a revision surgery could provide. So, I had a sleeve trim and single loop duodenal switch (SADI-S).

I felt very comfortable with this surgery choice. The SADI-S, or its earlier brother the DS, are often performed in two stages - first the sleeve to get the most dangerous weight off, and then the intestinal bypass at a later date to keep going. I'm currently 43/F/5'10""/250lbs. I feel really confident that I will get much closer to goal after this procedure.

Everything went great! Thought I would first do a little list of stuff I was glad I had and things I wish I had:

âœ… Pack of disposable toothbrushes. Amazing.

âœ… facial cleansing wipes. So good.

âœ… breath spray. Wish I would have brought Biotene for that Day 1/2 dryness though

âœ… my own pillowcase from home

âœ… My favourite Crystal Lite, broth packets, decaf tea. I stayed in hotel for a day before and 2 days after and I was glad to have my comfort liquids.

âœ… wish I had brought a 4 pack of Premier Protein shakes in my suitcase. They wanted me to drink them at the hotel for those last couple days, but I was in Tijuana with no one to send on errands, and the surgical unit only had these gross strawberry ones to sell me.

âœ… wish I would have remembered that I would be made to wear bright white surgical tights for the next week! I wouldn't have brought my adorable comfy culotte romper for the trip home ï¿½ï¿½

âœ… Audible. I traveled on my own, and found that I really liked just listening to books.

âœ… My favourite fancy body lotion. Made me feel great

âœ… wish I had some lactulose. I haven't pooped in a week."
Water goals immediately post gastric sleeve,"Hello!  I had my sleeve done yesterday and all went well. I have some gas pain but that seems to be working it's way out. My question is how much liquids were you getting in the first couple of days?  Realistically?  I was told to ""aim for"" 64 oz which I know isn't going to happen. It's pretty hard for me to get anything other than a tiny sip of water in then I have to take a break. I'm super afraid of getting dehydrated and having to go back to the hospital."
Cheese,"I'm almost two weeks out from rny and I've been very good about staying on my liquids diet (which also includes yogurt and jello), but holy jeez I want cheese. Just straight up cheese, melted cheese, cheese on things, CHEESE! I should be transitioning to the next food stage in a few days, but seriously I could eat a brick of goat cheese. Or Cheddar cheese. Or brie cheese."
On a scale of 1-10,"How did you feel overall 2-3 weeks post VSG? Were you overly tired? 

I want to see my dad for his 65th birthday 2.5 weeks after, but Iâ€™m afraid of being out of my comfort zone sleep/food/bathroom wise so shortly after surgery.
Iâ€™m torn."
Ever run into people that are TOO excited for you?,"My surgery is next week, and I've told a few co-workers that I'm having wls. One woman in particular is driving me nuts, approaching me multiple times a day for the past week or so. ""Aren't you SO excited?"" ""Only 5 days to go now!"" ""I think I can ALREADY see a difference!"" (I'm on the pre-op diet).  I had to replace my building badge/ID, and she said ""OH GREAT you can use that as a BEFORE picture!""

Like, calm your tits, Karen. I know you think I'm super fat. Can you please temper your enthusiasm?"
24 Hour Fast,Doing my first 24 hour fast.Iv been at a stall and keep either going up or down a pound so hopefully itll help. Last i ate was 7pm so i wont be eating until 7pm tonight..only water..wish me luck..im not the nicest when im hangry lol
Anyone have experience with revision? VSG to RNY?,"I'd just like to hear your experiences with revision. I'm about 2 years post VSG &amp; I'm not losing anymore. My surgeon had talked to me briefly about revision &amp; I'll be seeing him soon.

I'd like to know if you're happy with it or have regrets. "
RnY surgery on Tuesday! Tell me all the good things!,"Y'all I'm so excited and nervous! My RnY surgery is Tuesday. I find out today the specific time. I'm on a low carb diet right now, and Monday I'll be doing my liquids-only phase. 

I'm getting increasingly nervous, though. Can you tell me some of the great things you've experienced since having RnY? Any I should know that isn't already covered extensively in this forum? 

Yay!!! "
Worried about dehydration after WLS,I drink about 2 gallons of water per day. I get thirsty a lot and am pretty active for my size so ilI just always drink a ton. If i only drink a gallon I feel like crap... is this going to be a problem with WLS?
Threeterland?,"Iâ€™ve seen a lot of posts about â€œonderlandâ€ but I stepped on the scale today and Iâ€™m at 399. After four months in fourterland and a couple years in fiveterland, this feels pretty good!

VSG 4/30/19"
Day 4 of Optifast,Ok so by the title you can tell where I am in the process. I have 4 weeks of this to get through. I've had a massive headache for the past 2 days. Tylenol isn't helping it. Is this my body adjusting or am I doomed to have this headache for the full 4 weeks?
"One year sleeve anniversary was a month ago. I'm down 108 lbs. I don't have a lot of ""before"" pictures (which I'm ok with), but my husband ran across some last night. The change is insane.",
Going to my local support group tonight (Avon Ohio),"The subject is ""Surprises after surgery"".  

The biggest surprise for me was muscle loss, I was not prepared for the amount of muscle I lost after surgery.

The second is loose skin, I am not really surprised about it but just it affects me emotionally.  

**I am wondering what are some of surprises you had after surgery?**"
21 days out. Questioning my choice.,Surgery was 12/19. It went fine and the first week was ok. Normal gas pains. But for the last couple of weeks I have had severe indigestion. Doc put me on PPI but it isnâ€™t helping. I canâ€™t sleep at night and am now back at work and so tired!  I donâ€™t know how to make this go away. I never had GERD before. Iâ€™m worried that I will have it forever. 
You guys werenâ€™t kidding about the post surgery stall,"I am three weeks out and my weight is not moving, in fact it is up a pound from my lowest.  I know this is because my body is calibrating, and I can help it by making sure I get all my liquids in.  But damn itâ€™s a head trip.  Itâ€™s hard not to think about how fast I took of the weight in the four months before surgery, only to see it creeping along now."
Holy Crap. Its Happening!,"Just got the call today! Was told my surgery will be on May 9th. Less than 30 days!

It's been so far out for so long that it never felt real. Now that it's close, I'm nervous/happy/scared. :/"
Teacher considering WLS,"Iâ€™m wondering if there are any teachers out there who would recommend what time of year is the best to have WL surgery. I am just starting out in the approval process. It looks as though have a good chance of being approved, although I know the whole process usually takes at least six months. 

Are there any teachers out there who have done WL surgery mid school year? Christmas and Thanksgiving vacations are out for me. Spring break could be an option but I donâ€™t know if that would give me enough recovery time.

Iâ€™m thinking I may have to wait until next summer, in order to be approved and have the most recovery time. 

Any thoughts??"
1 day post surgery rant,"UPDATE: I just got home and it feels so much better. My stomach isn't bothering me so much, it's the horrible pounding headache and nausea that are making me sick. Also having a lot of anxiety because I'm afraid I won't get in enough water and there is no way I'm gong to get in any protein shakes today. Thank you all for the support, I absolutely love this community! 

Had gastric bypass yesterday, supposedly everything went well. The pain last night was excruciating and I had to wait forever for any pain meds. When I finally got dilaudid it barely touched the pain. Slept for about 30 minutes last night before they brought my roommate back from surgery around 3am and had all the lights on, full noise, etc. This morning I woke up to very little pain besides a blinding headache. After I reported that they canceled the order for dilaudid and gave me just tylenol. My roommate had 6 visitors at once for most of the evening and the noise from that did nothing for my headache. Finally got to see the doc 1.5 hours ago and she said she will order pain meds but still nothing yet. I understand they must be busy but this is so frustrating. I'm so nauseous and in pain and I'm having serious buyers remorse. I can't stop crying and I just want to go home. Thank you for listening. Please tell me it gets better. "
"23 weeks post RNY, down 90 pounds!",
surgery day!,"this is my first post in this sub, but i just wanted to share that today is my surgery day...waiting to go to the hospital now, feeling very anxious. iâ€™m getting the sleeve, any advice?"
Smoking after,Does anyone smoke weed after VSG? Or eat edibles? Vape? Iâ€™m not a regular smoker but occasionally liked to with friends and was wondering if anyone was able to smoke occasionally.
Preparing for my recovery week at home. What do I need?,"I am currently working on a list of stuff to get for my recovery week at home. So far I have: Gas X, Crystal Light, Chicken Broth. Anything else I should have on hand? My understanding is that I will be on liquids, so I wont need much."
"200+ pounds down, have a progress picture",
"I need food ideas, 5 weeks post op RNY","I'm so sick of what I have narrowed myself down to: protein shake, yogurt, tuna or chicken puree, cottage cheese.  I have my nutrition appointment in 2 weeks but I don't think i can make it.  For dinner I ate 1/4 cup of pasta wine cheese and spinach... waaaaaay off the rails.  HELP?"
I feel like a failure. (3 months post-op),"I had VSG back on October 19th, 2018. Since then I have lost a whopping 38lbs. 


I'm 3 months out and I feel like I could eat anything and everything I used to before. I only get the full feeling past 5-6 oz of food, I'm hungry all the time, even an hour after I ate a meal. 


I feel like a total failure, I've seen people lose so much more weight at this point. It doesn't help that my family, who are overweight themselves, keep trying to feed me and bring in all the junk food to the house. I feel like I can't control myself. It's really hard because I keep explaining to them that I don't want nor need to eat like them, that I want to try protein and veggies and they keep trying to feed me carbs and make all my old favorite foods. 

I don't know, I guess I just wrote this to vent. Has anyone else experienced this hard a time after surgery? How can I get back on track, I'm tired of feeling like a failure. What do I tell my family?"
"BMI settling, expectations","I'm wondering where people with WLS end up landing after, say, a year post-op (or whatever span of time to ""settle in"" and hold steady at some equilibrium). Where in the BMI range do they tend to fall?

When it comes to body mass (BMI), I'm just now crossing over the line from ""obese"" to ""overweight"". But looking at the ""normal"" weight range seems pretty hard to imagine. I'm male, 6'0"", and a normal weight range (BMI of 18-25) is about 140-185lbs. I'm 36 years old and I think I weighed 185lbs when I was 17 years old in high school and that was with 1 or 2 hardcore workouts per day, granted with a lot of carb intake and nobody schooling me on nutrition, but still, hardcore sports and generally being young and the best shape of my life. And I probably weighed 140lbs in middle school or something, so that seems silly. It seems like the BMI scale is a little exaggerated to me. Anyone else feel like that?  "
June Surgery Siblings!!!,"So I go in June 19th at 5:30 am for my bypass. I'm on day 2 of my liquid diet and I'm powering through it. Anyone else close a June surgery sibling?

Question for abdominal fat carriers,"I know that title sounds weird. I carried almost ALL of my fat in my abdomen.  How many of you have had WLS who had body comps like me?  I was 424 at my highest, currently at 294.  How on earth do I make myself shrink?  It's so hard to find clothes that fit.  I went from 6XLT to 1XL but I usually need a 2X because my belly is still so large..

I have a thick chest and broad shoulders but my stomach just wont die."
Almost 1 year post op. Curious to see what everyoneâ€™s â€œdietâ€ looks like.,"So we all know that the first few months around surgery all share a similar diet that get discussed at length in this form. Iâ€™m almost one year post op and would love to see more of a discussion on what everyone is doing further out in terms of their diets. Examples of questions Iâ€™m asking are do you restrict certain foods, do you count calories/macros, do you track calories, keto, paleo, Atkins, are you still waiting to drink water, eating only donuts? ï¿½ï¿½ Whatever it is Iâ€™m curious! Basically what are the different ways we are all still working our tools further out.

For example I am grain free, high protein, low carb, low sugar, and whatever for fat as long as it doesnâ€™t exceed my protein. I track my calories and macros. I still use small plates and bowls and a food scale. I found this works best for me, but Iâ€™m endlessly fascinated by nutrition and how different everyone is when it comes to their approach further out post op. So please share!"
7 months post op and my marriage down the drain. For those who had this happen how did you cope with sagging skin when dating/sex. Having a hard time here.,"So like my title says, I have been married for 3 years but in the relationship for 19 years. I could see the signs of the breakup coming and warning him but nothing changed. I gained more assurance and he was acting like nothing was changing and even negativly criticizing some of my choices, or poking fun at my loose skin. So it's done, it isn't easy but I'll get through it.

So I met someone new and after being with someone for 19 years and not much sex in the last year well, the hormones are a raging. I've told him that I've lost 110lbs (weighed in at 154lbs this morning) in 7 months so everything is floppy. He said he didn't mind so the deed was done. I felt so self conscious and it made me feel like I did not have as good a time as I should have had. I will talk with him about it eventually (he's working in a camp for 28 days and left this morning) but in the mean time can you share how you dealt with this kind of situation and give me pointers?"
Can you eat pizza after WLS?,"I'm halfway through my 30 day pre-op diet. I'm doing well except for when I'm around pizza. I'm suddenly starving and hangry (I don't cheat though). 

This got me thinking that I don't understand much about what my diet will be once I'm eating regular, solid food. I've had classes on so many topics regarding the surgery, dumping, nutrition pre-op and post-op (like vitamins and protein), emotional issues..etc..but not what every day meals 3 or 4 months post op will look like. I just assumed it would be lean protein and veggies with a little fruit. 

Do any of you eat foods like pizza? I'm assuming greasy pizza would cause issues. But what about healthier versions? Does it taste different?"
[rant] worst part about wls when youâ€™re female and childfree,"Periods!!! Obviously I know some women have this surgery to have a period so they can pregnant but not me. 

Ugh, before surgery it was non existent because excess weight but holy crap. Almost 6 months out and Iâ€™ve alresdy had 3 this year

I hate it. Make it go away. But the facial hair hasnâ€™t gone away??!

Seriously you guys, the stalling around that time of the month is so frustrating."
Telling People,"I don't go out of my way to tell people I'm having surgery. August. 20th is my surgery date. SOOOON. However, I'm not embarrassed or afraid to talk about it. I just have to be in the mood, I suppose.

However, my boss has taken it upon himself to tell three people (two of which work in part of our business, and one was just in the room when he decided to talk about it) without my consent. My boss has no understanding of personal boundaries, in this regard. However, his last day is a month from today. I'm so frustrated. I want to tell people on my terms, and I WANT TO BE THE ONE TO DO IT. Not him. Ugh. Just needed to put this out there somewhere.

Thanks for hearing me out. &lt;3"
Suggestions for Drinking Alcohol?,"I've never been a big drinker, but I was always a heavyweight when it came to alcohol. I have had no alcohol since surgery besides a sip of wine which went straight to my head. I'm heading overseas for a trip and I want to enjoy a drink or two while I'm there, but don't want to pass out. What are people's suggestions for drinking post-op? I'm traveling alone so I need to be careful while enjoying myself."
Self-Pay complications,"Hey!

So it looks like Iâ€™m going to be self paying for my surgery! Does anybody here have an experience for what to expect if there are complications? Does anybody know if you can purchase insurance in the event there are complications? Weight loss surgery is excluded from my plan!

Thanks"
Itâ€™s surgery day for me :0,"It feels like my birthday lol Iâ€™m leaving for the hospital in like 30-45 minutes aaah

Edit: thank you all everyone ï¿½ï¿½ things went well but now Iâ€™ve just gotta deal with the pain an nausea!"
Stalled ... any suggestions,Hello all.  I have been stalled for over two weeks now.  I decided to try upping my protein and lowering carbs to help break it.  Any other suggestions?  Has anyone else stalled this long?  I canâ€™t be done yet Iâ€™m not even four months out from VSG.  Thanks ahead of time.
Food addiction,"Hey yâ€™all,

Iâ€™m asking the age old question Iâ€™m sure: how do you guys handle the food addiction pre-op? Working with the nutritionist is great, she gives me all these great ideas to use, and how to cook at home, but cutting out the fast food and grazing at night just are so hard. 

Iâ€™m just looking for tips to help curb the urge to go through the drive through at 4pm on the way home from work and then have a meal at home prepared by my mom (Iâ€™m fresh out of college yâ€™all). Iâ€™m disgusted by myself and youâ€™d think that would be enough. 

Iâ€™m a teacher, so I love stopping at Tim hortons in the morning and getting a breakfast sandwich, and maybe one or two donuts. 
Someone brings in a snack to the teachers lounge? Heâ€™ll yeah. 

Iâ€™ve definitely gotten better, but I need to stop this shit before I postpone my surgery (slated for September) or worse. 

Idk if Iâ€™m an emotional eater, or I just eat bc my brain is craving the fast food all the time. 

Counseling of course is an option but Iâ€™m trying to come up with coping mechanisms that I can use when Iâ€™m not meeting regularly with a therapist. 

Thanks for your input and support my friends."
H. Pylori Infection Sucks.,"Yesterday I checked into urgent care at my healthcare center under the fear that I may have contracted a really back stomach infection or ulcer. The test results came back positive for a helicobacter pylori infection and I was prescribed 20mg of Prilosec OTC and was I instructed to inform my surgeon's office for additional follow up care. I feel really miserable, but my job is pretty low maintenance enough for me to be actively present while I recover.

I haven never dealt with this before and I would like to know how this was experienced by others who has been infected in the past. I read in previous post that some programs require testing during the pre op process to make sure that it won't be an issue after the surgery. My practice did not do this with me, or at least I was not aware of during my program. Any responses will be appreciated. Thanks!"
post surgery question: any weird hormonal changes?,"I had my operation (mini gastric bypass) 2 weeks ago and a few days after my surgery, my nipples are itchy and kinda chapped.  

My best guess is hormonal since there is no way I'm pregnant.

Anyone else get weird hormonal changes?"
Sleeve or bypass?,I've done quite alot of research on both and it seems pretty clear that bypass is better in almost every way which is why I am surprised to see most people getting the sleeve. Id like to hear reasons why people choose sleeve over bypass to help me make the decision. Thanks
What was your actual liquid intake post-op?,I'm three days post-op and barely getting in 25 ounces of fluid. My doctor wants 40-50 ounces.
Possible leak? Not sure whatâ€™s wrong &amp; wonâ€™t be able to speak to my surgeon but should I seek help?,"Hi there,

As the title suggests Iâ€™m worried I have a leak? Any advice would be great. 

I had my sleeve surgery 17/04 (9 days ago now)
I have been eating fine other than being bored with soup and struggling to get all of my protein shakes down.

I havenâ€™t had anything wrong at and thought it was just too easy and too good to be true. 
Yesterday I started getting pain below my lower ribs on my left side. Itâ€™s after I eat or drink anything but varies in severity. Breathing in can help it but sometimes starts or worsens the pain.
I have a very dull pain in my left shoulder but no other symptoms that I recognize.

It feels very similar to getting a stitch when running, am I just worried for nothing? If not I wonâ€™t be able to see my surgeon for another 2 days until Monday.

I was going to call my surgeon today but they are away for the super long Easter/Anzac Day holiday here in Australia."
Prizes for Goals,"Hey Everyone! 

Getting sleeved April 9 (would love some sort of group chat with surgery twins if anyone is interested!)

I am creating a list of milestones and coming up with (NON FOOD) related ""prizes"" for myself and wondered if anyone had any ideas? So far I've come up with buying fancy workout clothes (Ivy Park), going to an amusement park, and hiring a photographer friend to take pictures of me when I reach goal or close to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks fellow losers! :)"
Was not expecting this after surgery. Massive hematoma where they pulled my stomach and gallbladder out. [NSFW?],
I'm so grateful. Had surgery 2/7/19 and I'm down 60lbs. I hope everyone has a wonderful holiday and you're all amazing.,
Surgery Yesterday!,"Hey all! I had surgery yesterday and stayed overnight which is protocol at my facility. Itâ€™s 6:30am now and they JUST allowed me to have my first sip of water which is __heaven__.

Iâ€™m so excited for my journey ahead and I just wanted to say thank you to everyone here who Iâ€™ve been following. You have all really it has been a great support system. Also my boyfriend is here now (currently sleeping) and he has been here for me the whole way too.

Hereâ€™s to my new life!"
How much weight did you lose on your liquid preop diet?,"I have a 14 day liquid diet starting on 4/29.

 Not looking forward to it."
RNY recovery time,"I am planning on getting RNY, and I am considering scheduling it for holiday break (I am a teacher). One of my good friends had it done, and she said it took 2 weeks to recover before she went back to work.  I am wondering what other people experienced with recovery"
Stupid Question!,"How are weight loss surgeries different than anorexia or extreme dieting?

If I only ate 600 calories a day, would I lose the same as with wls. Iâ€™m assuming the answer is no, but I want to know what the difference is.

Iâ€™m getting the surgery, so Iâ€™m in no way advocating for anorexia. Just trying to understand."
Havenâ€™t lost weight for the past 4 days,Iâ€™m two weeks out from surgery and Iâ€™ve already stopped losing. I feel like a failure. Is this normal? 
"Almost a month out, and eating feels like an annoying nuisance. Is this normal?","My husband is about two months out and he feels the same way. As soon as I got onto soft foods I could tell eating wasn't fun anymore. Such small portions, so much chewing, the weird way it feels going down... Now for the past four or five days I just cant be assed to eat anymore. I was averaging 700-800 calories a day, now it's more like 400-500. I'm making my protein goal but I have to absolutely force it. Some days I'm so uninterested in eating, I just have a big glass of fairlife and go to bed. Is this a normal thing that happens after surgery? The day I got off liquids onto soft foods I was SO excited to eat. But it's just gone. 

It's a really confusing feeling. It's like I miss the comfort that I used to get from food, but I dont miss obsessing over it, being hungry all the time, having my day revolve around food. It's almost like breaking up with an abusive partner."
Is it possible to have weight loss surgery approved if I havenâ€™t seen a doctor in like...10 years?,"I know, I know. I should be seeing a doctor. Iâ€™m 30/F And I have been overweight for my entire life. I thought about it recently and Iâ€™ve probably gained and lost about 1200 pounds in my life. I just canâ€™t seem to keep it off. And now that Iâ€™ve had kids, I canâ€™t seem to lose a pound. Anyway, Iâ€™ve done extensive research on it and Iâ€™ve decided that WLS would be a good option for me. Iâ€™d also like to establish with a primary care doctor in the coming weeks. (Iâ€™m 99% sure I have issues with high blood pressure) I know that many insurances require years of documented weight issues. So I guess I was wondering if anyone had WLS approved through insurance without a primary doctor or documentation of weight loss issues. 
Iâ€™m at a point now where the weight is taking a toll on me. On my joints, on me trying to keep up with my kids, and honestly, my self worth. 
If anyone has any advice, Iâ€™d appreciate it. Thank you."
Worried about hair loss,"Hello all! I am having VSG, still not scheduled. Iâ€™m extremely nervous about the hair loss/thinning that is expected to follow VSG. Im sure itâ€™s different for everyone but can anyone share their experiences?

Did you take Biotin or something similar after surgery? Did it help?

Also, is there a difference between Bariatric vitamins and regular adult multivitamins?

Thank you in advance!"
Going on a vacation 9 days post op RNY,"So, I had my surgery scheduled for September 6th. Then I got a call from the clinic that the surgeon is on vacation that day, so they pushed it back 4 days to the 10th. I'm ok with that, I guess the surgeon should be in the office for the surgery.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I have a friends trip planned for September 19th. Nothing major, just a 2.5ish hour car ride to the beach, where we have a full kitchen etc, so I eat, well more like drink whatever I need to. I was ok with being 2 weeks post opp for the trip, but now I'll only be 9 days post opp. Is this a terrible decision? Unfortunately I'm the one who paid for the rental we'll be staying in and I didn't pay for trip insurance, and we're past the point of a refund..."
Face gains the left is my highest 367 and right is now at 271 sleeved on 4/8/19.,
Had RNY surgery on Monday morning:,"I'm almost 48 hours from my laprascopic gastric bypass procedure and having a serious difficult time sleeping. Every time I shift, even slightly, is like a new moment of pain. I too my prescription pain reliever but that only seemed to irritate my new pouch more.

Any suggestions on sleeping comfortably the first few days after bariatric surgery? "
Anyone drink smoothies?,"So I am quite a bit a ways out at 9 months. Iâ€™ve been drinking smoothies a few times a week lately mostly for the vitamins and fiber. Itâ€™s also low calorie. 

Iâ€™m just curious what everyone thinks of adding smoothies? I canâ€™t imagine going the rest of my life not eating fruit and I know most people say â€œitâ€™s so high carb!â€ So I almost feel guilty about it. *However* I rationalize it like this: they are good, natural carbs not added sugar or refined carbs.

And itâ€™s nice because I donâ€™t feel restriction with it. Itâ€™s like the one food I can eat where I donâ€™t get disgustingly full super fast lol."
Iâ€™m a week post op and worried Iâ€™m not eating enough calories.,"Iâ€™ve been consuming about 200-300 calories, And thats usually me forcing myself to eat. I do get hungry but full very fast. I donâ€™t feel nausea or no vomiting, just not hungry much. What did everyone else consume 8 days post op?"
"I've been trying to visualize how much weight I've lost. Well, one of my daughters is 64lbs. I've lost 60. Close enough",
Soft foods question,"I started soft foods today. I had normal protein shake for breakfast then a small serving of chicken, maybe two ounces for lunch. I feel like I'm going to puke. It feels like it is ""pushing up"" my throat and I feel so nauseated. What is going on?

Edit: I just threw up. Feel a bit better, but not great."
Whoa....first picture is from my wedding on 5/5/18 at 434lbs. Second pic is 5 minutes ago at 329lbs. Had gastric bypass on 11/27/18. Lost 40lbs since surgery but its stalled since I started weightlifting. ï¿½ï¿½â€â™‚ï¸ I feel so much better!,
Questions for people who did Skin Removal,"So I am nearing my 2 years since my sleeve. Im down almost over 200 pounds and havent been losing too much lately, I still want to get a little bit lower, but I do notice now that I have a bunch of loose skin which is expected after this excessive weight loss.

My question is, is there a process to getting the removal surgery? Like do i need a special surgeon or will any plastic surgeon work? Also any idea on if insurance covers these types of things? I know they didnt cover my Sleeve and i paid out of pocket. Mainly just curious on the whole process of what I should do since im really considering getting this done in the near future. I would ask my doctor who originally did the surgery but he ended up closing up shop and moving to the opposite end of the state (FL)"
Tonight I was a moron..FML,"I had Surgery on 2/26 Iâ€™m down 60-70lbs or so..which is great..but tonight my brain malfunctioned

The Girlfriend made hamburgers and I choose a smaller one..and out of what has to be idiocy and muscle memory I, using the scientific term â€œHoovered that sum bitch upâ€ like a completely tool bag. 

20 minutes later in the bathroom forcing myself to throw up because itâ€™s killing me. 

The moral of this story is 
Cut your food into 4ths and take 30 minutes to eat your sustenance. 

Donâ€™t be clown like me. 

I now return you to your regularly scheduled posts."
"For those that had RNY, how long did you stay in the hospital?",

NSV - Wearing 2xl shirt for first time in 8 years,"I stopped by Walmart this morning to grab a few things and decided to get a cheap 2xl shirt just so I could gauge my progress as I lose weight. My 3xl shirts are baggy on me but I didn't think I'd lost enough weight yet to go down a size. Put on my 7 dollar Mickey Mouse 2xl tshirt and it fit perfect.

First time in 8 years I've been under 300 lbs and first time in 8 years I've worn a 2xl shirt. Kind of cool."
Being realistic about the wls process to newbies,"The requirements between WLS programs vary dramatically . I looked at the requirements of three separate WLS programs and some of them by design are not cost effective to the patient.  

Deposits, multiple psych visits, in facility sleep studies, optifast, facility fees are all indications of programs that have monetized the WLS process.  

In the year prior to WLS I had a sleep study (at home), a video recorded EDG, a echocardiogram all due to digestive issues and high blood pressure. Two of the local WLS programs would have required me to repeat all of this. 

Before slamming someone about the complaining about the steps, take a minute to remember your journey may have been drastically different. Not everyone needs to check all the boxes based on their risk profile.  VSG surgery is different than RNY but most programs require identical steps.

Question for people post op,I was wondering if anyone found bariatric plates and special silverware helpful or are they just a waste of money?
Question about gulping fluids,"Hello all, this is my first post to this sub. I'm a 30 year old female in the very early stages of contemplating if WLS is right for me. This may be an odd first question, but at any point post surgery ( 6 months, 1 year, 2 years)  are you ever able to gulp down fluids again? I ask because although I'm obese I'm also very active. I'm a nurse and the reality is it's hard to get breaks some days. That leads to me chugging lots of water when I have a minute, sometimes I'm thirsty enough to down a while liter at once. I also like to work out and go on long hikes and such. I'm willing to forego these things for the benefit of being healthy. I'd even change my job for a while if that's what it took. But for those of you that are a year or more out, how do you handle when dehydration sets in or post vigorous work outs? I'm also wondering if you ever get to enjoy carbonated beverages again. I know you can't for a while, but I'm unclear if that's something you give up for the rest of your life?"

Fill-in the blank... â€œI chose/choose WLS because...â€,"...I want to live.â€

I lost my father incredibly early in life to severe, but largely avoidable, complications from diabetes.  This fall it will be 19 years since I lost him. He died 19 days before my 19th birthday. I will have lived half my life with him and half my life without him here on earth with me. Shit just got real. My daughter turned 11 last month and I canâ€™t imagine saying goodbye in 8 short years. Thereâ€™s so much more I want to see and feel. 

Iâ€™m not angry with my dad, I just want to get the help I need sooner rather than later. I hope this makes sense. 

I want to see my daughter grow up and know my grandkids. I like to think that if my dad couldâ€™ve done it again, he would have managed his diabetes as soon as it was diagnosed. I think denial played a huge role since he was in his 20s when diagnosed. It was only when the complications started that he actively managed his health...it was unfortunately too late. Kidneys damaged, transplants, heart and eye damage...I never knew my dad to be healthy. I was a small child when his health began to fail. I love my dad very much and hope heâ€™d be proud of me for using every tool available to meâ€”thatâ€™s what he did for as long as he could. He always used to tell us,â€When you know better, you do better.â€

"Unceasing hunger, 1 week after surgery (sleeve)","EDIT: thanks to everyone who suggested it, but I am on an acid control med already. Was prescribed by my surgeon before we even did the surgery. 

Hey all,

Little background. 35/m, had a band put in about 10 years ago. It was very tight but worked well, lost over 150 pounds. A little over a year ago, the tightness of the band caused my esophagus to stop working correctly, and I would choke and cough things up at night. Removing the fill helped that, but I gained over 100 lbs again. Got back in the program and was revised to a Sleeve on Monday the 4th.

Obviously I am still on post-op liquids, but I am just constantly hungry. Not like, I would like to eat, but a gnawing, unending, painful experience in my stomach. I am getting my protein in every 2-2.5 hours, without missing a beat. I am drinking water basically every other moment of waking (I'm getting well over 64oz a day).

I am always hungry. I never feel full, let alone satisfied. My wife (sleeve 2.5 years ago, still doing amazing) said this wasn't what she experienced post op at all, she had barely any feeling of hunger for a very long time.

This is really making me miserable. The first time I had surgery, this was not an issue for me. I mostly just WANTED to eat solid food, but actual *hunger* was not an issue. It is stressing me out and making me short with people and is also making it **incredibly** hard to sleep, which is saying something because I'm an insomniac even in the best of times.

The idea of going another week and a half before moving on to the next diet step is depressing to me. I could deal with it if it were just being bored with shakes/yogurt/etc., but it is not only that, it is real and very everpresent deep hunger.

Did anybody else have this kind of experience post surgery? How did it go for you? Did it ever stop while you were still on liquids, or even after that? Just looking for advice or anecdotes. Thanks."
"4 Months to the Day after Weighing in for my Pre-Op Diet, Down 100 lbs!","Weighted in at 377.6 on March 29th in advance of my April 8 surgery date and today I crossed the 100 pounds down barrier (100.4 pounds to be exact)!

It's been an amazing process so far and I'm really feeling strong and positive going forward.  For you pre-op folks out there, you can do this.  You really can.  I never successfully dieted in my entire life before this procedure.  Never.  But with the WLS tool, it all became manageable and the results are really incredible if you truly dedicate yourself to succeeding.  It's hard work but it is amazing!!!"

Sleeve or bypass,"I just had my initial consultation with the surgeon. I walked in thinking the sleeve would be my best option but now I'm not sure. The surgeon did state I would be a great candidate for either surgery, but there seemed to be emphasis on why the bypass would be better. He mentioned a few things that I had not considered before such as the bypass has 50 years of data vs the sleeve having 15 (or 20 I don't remember). He states the data shows more hunger and weight re gain than the bypass. Plus the bypass has an overall higher expected weight loss. He referred to it as the gold standard of WLS. 

I guess at the end of the day he didn't say anything I didn't know already (except that you can become more fertile after you lose some weight ï¿½ï¿½)

What threw me was the body language and tone of voice. It's hard to explain but it felt like he was nudging be towards bypass. This has left me feeling uncertain. ï¿½ï¿½"

Workout Clothing for Men after WLS?,"Hi everyone! 

I am led to understand that women may be more familiar with this topic (but please don't let that stop you from responding if you have some awesome advice!) but I am looking for some suggestions in the male workout clothing area. 

I am about 135 pounds down after VSG back in April, and about 2 months ago SO and I started Crossfit. It has been awesome, and we really want to keep it going. 

The problem I am having is that normal compression wear isn't really cutting it in the ""flappy"" department. It seems I now have a lot more bouncing around, and when I run it feels like I am landing twice. I have tried a couple things on my own, but tighter compression shirts/undergarments seem to ""roll"" during the workout and end up being more of a pain then a help. Currently I am trying out a men's waist trainer to hold everything together during the workout and it seems to be working better, it's just awful thick. 

I was wondering if others had suggestions or resources that worked for them during this stage? Stuff you loved or hated? 

Thanks for any help! 

EDIT: I probably should have mentioned, I still have about 50 pounds to lose before I am goal weight territory. Right now the support needs are more then I will require once I am in goal weight territory if that makes a difference. "

Cost of VSG Surgery through NY Bariatrics,"Hi All!

I have decided to to have VSG surgery and I am now searching for the place to do it. My insurance doesn't cover the surgery and I just want to make sure I have a good idea of the charges. I am considering NY Bariatrics and after a call with them, these were the costs they mentioned. Is there any hidden charges or something else that's missing from the below?

UPDATE: I had my consultation with the surgeon yesterday. I was weighed and told that I would be a good candidate because my BMI is 40.

I was excited but a bit of nerves popped up I didn't have before. Not enough to talk me out of it, but enough to be like... the cards are on the table and it's now reality."
Psyc. issues...again,"I had my second to last appt with the Psychologist today for the Bariatric program after trying to get approved since late last year. My final appointment with him is in two weeks. During these two weeks, the Psychologist told me to practice eating my binge foods in small portions. He believes if I am able to eat small amounts of chocolate and ice cream and not binge on it, then I have my binge eating disorder under control and he'll approve me for surgery.

I'm finally at my goal pre-surgery weight. I feel as though I have my binge eating under control. I have a solid routine down that does not include eating my trigger foods (chocolate, pizza, and ice cream). I really don't want to do this as I think it's a slippery slope. When I protested, he said that indicates to him that I don't have my binge eating disorder under control and am probably not ready for surgery.

I feel so conflicted. I want to listen to him because he's the expert, but I don't want to lose the grip I have on my binge eating."
Hi I had VSG 4/1/19 SW 224 and I have lost 17 lbs thus far. I've been at 207lbs for almost 3 weeks now and I don't see the scale dropping. Even on a 500-800 calorie a day diet. Any advice ? What am I doing wrong?,

I should feel happy about my weight loss but I don't... In fact I feel pretty upset with myself right now.

Weight loss surgery is truly only a tool, it does NOT fix your food addiction. Sure I've lost 55lbs overall and that's great but I haven't worked that hard for it. It's so hard to face that fact but it's true. The only reason I'm losing weight right now is because I can only fit half a burger in my stomach, not 2. But obviously my choices are still shit. I'm sorry for the language, but I'm so upset with myself because I'm realizing that food addiction is still ruling my life. This pisses me off so much. It's plagued me almost my whole existence and it's defeated me in at least 20 diet battles in my life, hence why I sought help with Gastric Sleeve. And I realized... It's still winning. Chinese one day, pizza the next. Not necessary but I do it. Why? Because it tastes sooooo good. Some people think Heroin feels soooo good and yet they have to quit if they want to survive and thrive. My addiction is the same. I want to grow old with my fiance, and pass on healthy habits to our future children. And yet I'm giving all of that up with each greasy French fry I shovel in my mouth.

I just need to put this into the universe and make this a concrete statement: I'M DONE LOSING THE WAR. FOOD IS FUEL, NOT HAPPINESS. I can do this. It feels impossible right now but... I can do this. I have to."
Post operative anxiety and panic,"Hi everyone! Iâ€™m so grateful this sub exists. I had my RNY two days ago on Wednesday. It went well, everything looks good, Iâ€™ve not vomited once, and I am mobile and urintaring.

But- hospital stays trigger some PTSD in me. My night in the hospital, I had a high heart rate. And it sent me in to a panic, so the rate got higher or wouldnâ€™t come down.

They ran a CT scan of my chest, did an EKG, and an echocardiogram. All came back clear and normal.

Iâ€™m home now, and I just canâ€™t shake it. I canâ€™t shake the nerves and terror that I was feeling that night. Even with the reassurance from doctors that Iâ€™m good, I just have anxiety that is nearly paralyzing.

Protein Shakes questions,"So I have recently started having protein shakes as I don't think I was getting enough protein. I usually only have 3 meals a day without doing the snack meals.

I thought adding in 2 protein shakes a day, 5oz/150 ml of low fat milk/almond milk would be easy. I tried with water and wanted to puke. Can it be mixed with anything else? I don't have much milk in a day, a dash in my coffee in the morning, about half a cup in my cereal and then the 2 shakes. This is way above my 8oz/250ml milk allowance though. 

I have breakfast about 7:30 am and then lunch at 12. Does the protein shake count as a full meal that I am required to only have 3 hours after another meal? Or does it fall into the liquid rule, just don't have it 30 min before a real meal?

Does anyone else also feel really full after a protein shake?"

8 months post op from rny ï¿½ï¿½,
Stage 1 â€œcheatâ€,"Thought that Iâ€™d share my little discovery...

For my clear liquids stage, my surgeon wanted me to include fat free Fairlife milk in addition to broths and water. Three things that I am COMPLETELY over. 

So I had the idea to add a packet of pineapple Crush sugar free flavor  to my milk today and thank omg it tasted like a milkshake! I literally danced around the house while doing my 30min walk. 

But hereâ€™s the best part...Before I finished, I put it in the freezer for a few hours and right before it fully freezed, ate it in its â€œalmostâ€ ice cream consistency.

Surgeon consult just got moved from late August to next week...now Iâ€™m panicking!,"Last week I attended an informational seminar to learn more about wls and the different types offered. The surgeon giving the presentation (1/2 in the practice) leaned very heavily toward VSG. I was so encouraged sitting through the seminar that I went ahead and scheduled my one-on-one consult with the other surgeon to get the ball rolling. It was scheduled for the end of August, and now a waitlist spot opened up so they moved me to next week. Whoa! Now my mind is racing. How soon would I realistically have the surgery? My insurance only requires one dietician visit, then I would have a psych eval (v worried about passing this, given mental health history) and a few other hoops. 

How realistic is it that my surgery would be yet this year? If likely, Iâ€™m wondering if it would be better to schedule it for early next year for insurance purposes (meet my OOP max early, rest of year is covered??) or to try to get it done sooner rather than later. 

How worried should I be about passing the psych eval? Iâ€™ve been on medication for depression and anxiety for 15 years (since I was 13) and regularly see a therapist, but Iâ€™m afraid my emotional connection to food (mainly for reward/celebratory purposes) will hurt me. 

I also had some acid reflux issues when I was pregnant and am wondering if that will disqualify me from VSG.

Help a lady out,"Hello. First post.  Cw: 315, pre surgery.

I need some encouragement/advice/ something.

After years of battling the mental stigma I had about undergoing wls, I finally decided to do research and talk to my doctor. I have anxiety so I've been researching like crazy, including looking up my insurance online (Providence health plan) to ensure coverage. Their website stated in network covered, so I figured I was fine and kept researching. So today (I have PCP appointment scheduled for this upcoming week to start the actual process) I decided to call Providence to find out what kind of hoops I have to jump through prior to surgery approval.

I was just informed my insurance doesn't cover wls of any kind that is non emergency. Apparently my employer doesn't buy the right coverage, wtf??? I didn't even know this was a thing????

I'm devastated. I'm crying my eyes out. I finally felt like I could make this insane difficult choice and then slammed into a brick wall comprised of a shitty insurance reality and a $30k surgery I can't even dream of affording.

I'm not getting the results that other posters seem to be getting! Any fellow lurkers have the same issue?,"SW 243 CW 191 I had RNY on 12/17 and I've lost about 52 lbs.  The last 2 months I lost about 10 lbs per month.  It seems like a fraction of most of the posters.  I know people often say to not compare ourselves to others, but it seems striking?"
Anyone have success with surgery without changing eating habits in advance?,"I'm a serial-dieter. Calorie counting, keto, gyms, aquafit, promising myself it's a lifestyle change that doesn't have an end date (spoiler alert, there's always been an end date). I ALWAYS fall off, usually at 3 months.

I'm extremely lucky to live in a country where WLS is covered for extreme cases, but I got cold feet last time I was in a WLS program because I have food addiction and didn't trust that a few months of dieting/lifestyle change was enough to make sure I was rid of my demons enough to be successful after surgery.

I have a fear of gaining it all back plus more after surgery. I have a fear of losing my eyesight and other terrible things if I don't get my shit together before surgery and maintain it the rest of my life. And I know it happens! I met a woman in OA (overeaters anonymous) who had surgery and she still struggled and gained it back.

I'm an early 30's woman weighing around 380 lbs and I. AM. DONE. with this body and shitty lifestyle. Some days I feel like I'm done really living at all (I'm on meds for depression). So I'm finally just like, fuck it. I'm going to get WLS whether I'm ready or not because I feel like there's nothing to lose at this point. I have chronic pain, I'm too large to do much in this body, I eat terrible food, I'm too big to have children, it's starting to affect my work, I feel like I have no future... So hopefully WLS itself will be enough of a kick in the butt? Maybe through WLS I will actually see and feel results that keep me accountable?

Did you or anyone you know go into WLS without having ""fixed"" their ways and it worked out after surgery long-term?"

I decided to start tracking again and Iâ€™m aghast that by noon Iâ€™ve managed to pack in 750 calories already. Only 22 G protein. To hit my goals I need to only eat 250 calories more for the rest of the day. It will never happen so I know Iâ€™ll be at least 1200-1400 today. When I was losing Iâ€™d be at 200-300 calories at this point. Iâ€™m so disappointed in myself at the moment. I swore this wouldnâ€™t happen. I wouldnâ€™t blow this gift I was given. My jeans feel snug today. I cant face getting bigger clothes. Spring is here and I have to get back on track. This is such a life long struggle. I know that I will get support here and this community understands. I really just needed to vent my feelings. We all go into this so rosy and excited and all the progress and success photos are awesome. But the hard work that goes into that canâ€™t be minimized. At least for me every pound is lost or gained with pain and effort. The sleeve only takes you so far and you can learn to eat around it. Trust me itâ€™s too easy to do."
3 months post op and already needing an iron infusion. Super bummed and dont know what to do,"I just did my first round of blood tests (aside from the ones the day after surgery) and overall they were fucking awesome. All my vitamin levels are the same as preop, fasting blood glucose went from 87 to 70 and all the elevated results I had from having an overtaxed liver and kidneys are falling dramatically. It's just iron. Fucking iron. I've always had issues with it, dont know why. My surgeon and I discussed it and knew having RNY instead of VSG was riskier due to the low iron, but I have had awful reflux/GERD for years and my mom has Barretts. I tried to be optimistic.  

Well, it's bad. Iron pills don't seem to be doing anything and the constipation from them is so bad I'm concerned about getting a fissure. According to my results, normal iron level is 50-170. Preop I was 43. Today I am 29. My hands are freezing all the time, I get headaches and my energy is low. 

So the confusing thing is I've talked to my surgeon about it and my gastroenterologist and they have literally opposite opinions. The surgeon thinks infusions should be avoided at all costs because they will destroy your liver if you have to do them enough times. The gastro thinks they're a no brainer, just do it and dont worry about it. He thinks the pills serve no purpose and just constipate you. He said he's never, ever heard of infusions hurting your liver.  

I plan to get a third opinion from my GP, but I'm curious what everyone here has been told by their doctors. I've seen a few people around here saying they have needed infusions. I'm only 29. If I can't fix this am I just going to be doing infusions once a year for the next fifty years? My surgeon recommended trying PatchMD, I know it is controversial, has anyone had luck with it?"
Dizziness when standing up.,"Hello everyone!
I'm 6 months out of surgery, 40kg down and eating well / hitting my protein goals and taking my vitamins correctly.

But every time I quickly stand up i feel dizzy, sometimes to the point of almost fainting.

Does that sound familiar to you guys?
I was thinking it could be due to the drastic weight loss, or low blood sugar, but it is starting to get on my nerves."
Gastric Band,Hey everyone! I have just made an appointment with a surgeon for a consultation at the end of January! I was hoping for some more stories/experiences/advice from people who have had the band? That is what Iâ€™m going in hoping to get so was just after some advice :)
Vomiting a bit of blood,"Food makes me vomit sometimes. Especially if it's fried food. So when I throw up there is always a little blood coming with it.

Should I alert the hospital or is it normal? I'm 2 months post op and I have a sleeve."
Something is wrong with me (?),"Hey guys, Its been like 5-6 months now since I had my surgery. I lost like 55kg. I am at 75kg at the moment and very happy that I did the surgery. However there is something I cant seem to get rid off. It first happened 2 weeks after surgery where I started getting a tingly feeling in my body, feeling uncomfortable in breathing and feeling weak in my arms and legs, after that my body cries for something sweet like sugar or peanut butter. 

It usually goes away after 20min, but making me extremely tired suddenly. I brushed it off the past 5 months but this night it happened and in the morning as well when I had my exams, couldn't even concentrate for a second feeling like my body is dying and I'm about to fall down. It also happened before I started writing this thread.. Im just curious if any of you know what the problem might be or if any of you guys ever had this issue as well and what solved it? 

My mother says its just hyperventilating but I doubt its that.

EDIT: 'I also get quite sweaty and cold after such an ''attack''."

Post-op Regret?,"So I had my surgery March 21st of this year. Sleeve gastrectomy. Everything went fine. I was feeling fantastic for the two weeks recovery at home. So much energy, so full of just wanting to move and do something. Exact opposite of my life up till then. I was really happy but I was also worried it wasn't going to last. Well, it didn't. A month out, I'm miserable. I can't eat hardly anything without my stomach getting sick. And what I can eat, I can barely eat any. Everything tastes bland and unappetizing and just, things I used to love I can't stand to eat now. My energy levels have gone back down to pre-surgery, my weight loss is at a standstill. From the point of starting this process till now, I've lost 50 lbs but I need to lose at least another 150-200. It doesn't seem like I'm making any progress and I'm just miserable from trying to find things to eat. The thought of this being the rest of my life is making me wonder if I made the wrong decision. Has anyone else dealt with this? Is this normal?"
Any US WLS friends want some free protein gifts? I canâ€™t get these to Australia with the forwarding service I used so I either have to pay to have them destroyed or pay to forward them to a US address so rather gift it if someone is keen for some free gifts?,
How much weight did you lose in your first few weeks of WLS?,"I did not expect to lose weight this fast, especially since I have been losing weight for over a year pre surgery.   I am down 10 pounds in my first week. :D


My pants are already getting loose! I am so excited!"
Just had my VSG and feel like shit. But Iâ€™m so excited. Thanks for all the info. Will make proper post when Iâ€™m feeling better.,
I did it!!!! Weary Gastric sleeve patient UPDATE,"So I made a post here the day before, considering canceling the surgery after 8 months of prep. So here we go:

I went into the hospital at 9:30am. The surgery room was backed up so they finally got me in at 12:30. After all the waiting, I had made up my mind that was the right path for me and 2 hrs later I was sleeved. 

When I woke up, I was in no pain but did have mild gas discomfort. Nurses brought me tiny ml cups of water, telling me to try and finish it within an hour, and then 2 every hour when I was ready but to take it slow. 

I mostly slept and the walked around the hospital floor for around 10 minutes @around 4am. The next day I was doing 2 cups of water with no problem, and was given broth, lemonade, Apple juice, tea and more water. Downing what I could slowly. More walking for the gas. 

Was discharged @6:00pm and am now in bed at home with more tiny cups of water, broth and (believe it or not) a lot of food network. 

I feel great! Currently not on meds, but No pain, manageable gas pressure and am able to move around on my own all though my BF hasn't left my aide. I'm excited to start this new life, and feel very hopeful!

I can't thank you all enough who lent me your thoughts on my pre-surgery anxiety. I know I've made a good choice for myself, and I'm ready to learn my new stomach. Thank you!!!

eighty pounds later. (VSG 12/10/18),
Post-Op Fatigue issues - is it normal?,"Howdy! Iâ€™m 1 month post-op Sleeve Gastrectomy and Iâ€™m really struggling with extreme lethargy. I thought Iâ€™d be feeling much more energetic by now. Had anyone else had this experience?

My dietitian and General Practitioner have indicated Iâ€™m on track with my vitamins and minerals, caloric intake, fluids/water and protein levels (bloodwork confirms this). I am in a pretty strong state of ketosis as Iâ€™ve been avoiding carbs now for 2 months. Iâ€™ve been told I can reintroduce small portions of carbs and can safely up my iron supplement to see if this makes a difference. 

Iâ€™m really starting to get worried as I feel like I have slipped back into chronic fatigue (something Iâ€™ve struggled with for years but recently overcome). If I do something as simple as going to the shops, or washing up, or even having a shower and washing my hair, Iâ€™m buggered and need to sit down for a while. By about 1 or 2pm I feel like I need an afternoon nap.

I originally only planned for 3 1/2 weeks off work and have had to take an extra 2 weeks. I work a hectic job and Iâ€™m mindful of how stressful/busy itâ€™s going to be getting back into it. Mind you, this is the first â€˜holidayâ€™ Iâ€™ve had in nearly 2 years (working ~60 hours per week).

Iâ€™m really happy with my progress (lost 10 kgs/20 pounds in 1 month; total weight loss = 28 kgs/56 pounds). I just canâ€™t wait to start feeling more energetic again!

Any suggestions for things to look out for or how to improve energy levels would be seriously appreciated ï¿½ï¿½"
Anxiety,Iâ€™m on the final steps before we set up my surgery date. My doctor asked me which surgery I wanted and we agreed on the sleeve. My mother and father both had the full bypass and theyâ€™re worried that I will have the same outcome as my uncle. He gained most of his weight back and now has to get a full bypass. Should I just go through with it and get the full bypass? Iâ€™m so scared about all this. This is the biggest decision Iâ€™ve ever had to make in my life and I was wondering if anyone had any advice. Thank you.
Can we talk about what your hunger was/is like pre-op?,"Obviously a big reason why we get this surgery is because we havenâ€™t been able to successfully lose weight, so presumably weâ€™re all Hunger Experts, right? 

Yesterday night, I ate dinner around 6:30 or 7:00pm. I got into bed around 9:00pm intending to read for a bit and then go to sleep. At that point in the day, Iâ€™d had about 1425 calories (Iâ€™m F40, 5â€™4â€, 255lbs) including about 125 g of protein and five servings of fruits and veggies. In other words, I did everything â€œright.â€  

I had also spent a while researching the new generation of weight loss drugs earlier in the day. My surgeon mentioned them as an option during my consult; I know the office will prescribe them before or after surgery. Seems like thereâ€™s the stimulant drug thatâ€™s been around forever but you canâ€™t take indefinitely, plus a drug that are used to treat diabetes so works on insulin/blood sugar factors, a drug that reduces appetite but is not a stimulant, and a drug that reduces cravings. (Of course, none of these are covered by my insurance either - they wonâ€™t even pay for a single visit with a nutritionist, but theyâ€™ll happily cover my blood pressure drugs or my quadruple bypass! Eyeroll.) But anyway, researching these non surgical options made me curious about my hunger in general. 

Around 9:30pm last night, I was hungry. I was really trying to analyze it. Is it â€œhead hunger?â€ Low blood sugar? Obviously not a lack of protein. Is this a craving? Which drug would I pick to stop this? Itâ€™s like I donâ€™t even speak the language of hunger. Iâ€™m just hungry. Emotionally, I was cozy in my bed and about as excited to crawl out of bed to deal with my hunger as I would be to get out of bed to pee. I didnâ€™t want to eat. It was no more enticing than peeing. But I also didnâ€™t want to feel this annoying urgent physical sensation anymore. So I decided Iâ€™d find something to eat. 

I thought about what I could have... I knew I didnâ€™t want grapes.  I knew from the past that grapes wouldnâ€™t â€œstickâ€ when I felt like this. I also didnâ€™t just want water. My belly was grumbly and I knew itâ€™d be grumbly 15 minutes after eating grapes or drinking water. I wasnâ€™t light headed or faint. I was just very grumbly tummied. I also didnâ€™t want any particular junk food either. I decided to have a protein shake, 150 calories. I felt much better after that. Both physically and emotionally, I felt the â€œreliefâ€ you feel when you go pee. 

Was that a craving? Head hunger? Appetite gone wild? Emotional eating? I donâ€™t even know how to articulate it, but itâ€™s always that grumbly tummy feeling that makes me fail at diets long term. 

I *got* fat because I ate and drank whatever I wanted in my teens and twenties. I woke up at 30 and tried to be better, but I feel like Iâ€™ve broken the system in my body that regulates hunger. But then I wonder... did I really? Maybe Iâ€™m still BSing myself. Maybe Iâ€™ll have this surgery and discover that the protein shake actually WAS just an emotion-driven choice that no drug or surgery can fix. 

Iâ€™m trying to approach this process with a lot of intellectual curiosity, and itâ€™s making me very curious about hunger. What is your experience with hunger in all forms, both pre and post surgery?"
Pre-Op Liquid Weight Loss,"I am curious, for the 1 week pre-op liquid diet how much did you all lose? Also since doctors instructions tend to vary, what were the guidelines for your 1 week pre-op diet?

Extra Details:
My doctor wants me to lose 10lbs before surgery, no plan was given, he just wanted me down some from my highest weight. I have been working at it for 2 months and have lost 3lbs, with only one month to go. (Not for lack of trying, I track everything and according to my calorie defecit I should be losing 1lb/week...) 

My doctor only requires 1 day of clear liquids before surgery, but I am thinking maybe I should do liquids for longer pre-op (since most people have to anyways) to lose the last of the 10lbs and not be stressing too hard about the fact that I'm not losing it now... So I guess ultimately what I am trying to figure out from your experiences is roughly how long I would need to do liquids to make sure I lose the rest of the 10lbs..."
Considering,"Hello, all!  I'm a 39F, 5'11"", 286lbs. My doctor brought up the idea of WLS at my last visit, and at first I had a visceral ""no"" reaction, but now I'm considering it more seriously. The thing is, I start crying when thinking about it. My mental talk is trying to say I've ""failed"" at doing it the ""right"" way. At least twice now I've lost over 100 pounds doing things the traditional way, and countless dozens of pounds at other times. So I know I have enough discipline and willpower to a certain extent. And I know how I should be eating, and I know how to cook what I need to. But I'm almost back to where I started, weight-wise. I know part of the problem is a sugar addiction; as soon as I have ANY, it kills any progress I've made in avoiding sugar for X amount of time. And yet if I think I can just cut it out forever, I feel that desperate deprived feeling, and likely end up on a binge. The same way with needing to feel ""full""...If I don't feel full after I eat, I'm combating the mental effects of scarcity. That's one of the main draws to WLS for me, that I'd feel full on very little.

Another factor in all this is all the adults around me--husband, MIL, FIL, BIL--have had WLS, and they're all back to where they started. Personally I don't think they put in the work they were supposed to. And none of them exercise or anything. Where I do running and yoga and weight lifting and I LIKE using my body. Part of feeling like I'm a failure is having to ""resort"" to WLS surgery, and I couldn't do it the right way as an example for them.

I haven't actually been actively working on the WLS requirements, but I think I've happened to meet them. I've been actively working with my doctor on weight loss since the fall, I've tried soooooo many ""diets,"" and addressed it via pharmaceuticals (I'm actually on a faux-Contrave trial right now), and I have documented co-morbidities. (Though there again my mental talk is trying to say they're not THAT bad. Just pre-diabetes, GERD, chafing, fatigue, depression.) The psychological screening seems pretty easily addressed. 

Any comments or encouragement (or a reason not to do it, if applicable!) would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

I'm so sick of my bones digging into everything,"Not a problem I thought I would have, frankly, especially with 90 pounds left until my goal. But furniture is getting less and less comfortable. I'm thinking about getting a mattress topper because my hip bones are digging into my bed and keeping me awake. I used to be able to lay on my back with my phone on my chest, but now it digs into my sternum. The other day I was cuddling with my husband and my shoulder blades were digging into his ribcage (he also had surgery and has lost 100 pounds). It's a common sentiment now for us to say ""you're hurting my bones"". 

How do you deal with this? Do you get more used to it, do things ""redistribute"" after a while?"

But I guess when I see myself everyday, I see a big change â€” just not as much I guess since Iâ€™m probably used to seeing myself in the mirror.

Advice sorry a little long post. Looking at gastric sleeve,"My wife is concerned that since I am not able to stick to a diet/keep making good choices then surgery would be harder since I would then have a lifetime commitment of diet changes. I have addictive tendencies. Food is my current addiction, upset eat food, sad eat food. I know that can be risky of falling back into old tendencies after surgery. 

I really want the surgery and have all my insurance requirements met. I am just scared to make the leap. The doctor said with the psychological changes I should like new healthier foods. 

I am a picky eater and cannot stand the taste of some healthier choices. I am done being so overweight but can not control myself at times when it comes to eating. Please help me in guidance. "

RNY On Friday with complications. help with protein?,"I had an rny on Friday The 18th a week ago, and my surgeon said it went great, by the time Sunday came around we knew something was wrong, I was still in the hospital with a huge distended stomach not keeping even water down, so I had emergency surgery and they found a ""kink"" in my stomach, fixed it, and I'm where I'm at now, They sent me home yesterday because the pain is gone, but now I'm at home I'm having trouble drinking protein, and I'm at a loss, I feel lost, my water intake is low, and I'm trying to keep up with liquids. I've just had a super hard week with two surgeries in the hospital and  I'm low energy and I just don't know what to do."
Am I doing protein shakes wrong?,"So Iâ€™ve tried a few protein powders and I canâ€™t stand them. My surgery was just scheduled for 5/8 and Iâ€™m worried I wonâ€™t have this figured out.
I put the protein powder and water or milk in a shaker bottle and shake it up and it becomes frothy on top and has chunks of powder still no matter how much I shake. The froth and the chunks make it unpalatable. Am I missing something here? Iâ€™ve even tried stirring instead of shaking. Same problem.

Magic Spoon,"Not sure if I can do this, so please delete if I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m not affiliated, but just sharing.

A good friend of mine put me on to a great cereal (heâ€™s responsible for my love or Impossible Burgers, too) recently that is perfect for people like us. Itâ€™s called Magic Spoon and is an â€˜adultâ€™ version of kids cereal (think Froot Loops, Frosted Flakes, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, etc). Itâ€™s only got 12g protein per bowl and 1 net carb. 

Itâ€™s a little pricey at like 40 bux per case (4boxes) but itâ€™s really good. Not exactly the same, but close enough. Iâ€™m about halfway through my first case and will probably order more, but Iâ€™m not a fan of the cinnamon (might be because my first bowl was with almond milk, which Iâ€™m still getting used to).

He knows two people who have had the surgery. One had massive complications and is on a permanent feeding tube 5 years later.   


The other gained all the weight back.   


He's more worried about complications, it seems, but he doesn't have a great view on the surgery based on his experiences.   


Now, I don't want to hear a bunch of ""dump him"". He's not trying to forbid anything, he's not getting in the way. He's concerned. He's worried about me. He wants me to be safe.

A Little Sad...,"I went to the info session at the local(ish) surgeon on Monday, and I've started my process toward surgery - I'm really leaning toward RnY, but trust the surgeon to help me make the right choice.

Im 31 (32 in a little more than a month) and my husband and I don't have kids yet. My semi-recently diagnosed PCOS has been a factor in deciding to pursue wls. In the presentation, the surgeon mentioned that surgery is not for those who plan on getting pregnant ""shortly"" before or after surgery.

Today I found out that ""shortly"" is 18-24 months post-op, and I'm a little (ok, more than a little) sad about that.

I understand that it is about healing and being healthy enough to have a healthy pregnancy and baby. I know that not doing this might mean that I never have children, and that doing this means that I'll be around for my kids for a long time. Still, I've been ready to be a mom for YEARS at this point. It seemed like as soon as my husband told me he was ready, I started having wonky periods. Now, I'm staring down a 2-3+ year wait, because my insurance requires 6 months of a documented weight loss program before approving the surgery, and when I talked to the wonderfully helpful woman at the bariatric center today, she was talking about a surgery date in early 2020. 

I've been weepy, sad, and disappointed this afternoon - mostly in myself. It's been a REAL pity party.

Anyone else have this experience, or have words of support?"

Loose skin question,"So, itâ€™s been about 3 months since my RNY and Iâ€™ve already lost about 60 pounds. I feel great! I started out at only 38 BMI and Iâ€™m a relatively young 39 years old. Iâ€™m 6 foot 5 inches tall and I hope to lose about 100 pounds total (so Iâ€™m about 60% to my goal). 

I thought Iâ€™d skate right through without any loose skin but today I noticed a little sagging around my butt cheeks and sides. Is it possible that my skin could tighten up? The weight loss has been so quick that Iâ€™m hoping the skin just needs time to catch up. Is this just a pipe dream? Is loose skin always just loose skin? I understand that no one can know for sure until it all plays out but Iâ€™m just wondering if itâ€™s even possible. "
Why are the vast majority of WLS patients women?,"My surgeon said 90%+ of his patients are women, and it seems like most information on WLS is geared towards women. I was just wondering why do you guys think this is? Obesity rates are the same with men and women, why dont men get WLS more often?"
Surprised at changes Post op,"5 Weeks out, and Doing good, but I a bit surprised at how much energy and things I'm doing. I had it all in my head I would get to the 6 month mark, and I would lose some weight, go back to my old eating patterns, just less, and life would roll on.

But, everything is different. Maybe it's the hormones or energy, or I dunno.

Food is a tool, not a real pleasurable thing anymore, and I'm not sad at all about it. That shocks me more than anything.

And I've signed up for the gym. I didn't think I was going to do that at all pre-op.  But  Planet fitness is now my morning home. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's wicked exciting, really.

questions about sugar,"I'm trying to figure out if after surgery (specifically the sleeve) if things like honey, maple syrup, agave are okay to eat? Is there a scientific reason to NOT consume small, portioned quantities, of those specific sugars after surgery if I don't have dumping syndrome? Is the reason that surgeons say ""ONLY no calorie sweeteners"" because it's added calories/dumping syndrome? Or is there something I'm missing here?   


I'm asking because I'm allergic to stevia and most artificial sweeteners give me hella headaches. I tolerate sugar alcohols alright but those are hard to find in products. I currently use things like maple syrup, agave, honey (from my moms hives) to sweeten food when needed but in limited quantities and always measured.  


Second to that: in my googling about this issue, I came across a few surgeons who suggested sleeve patients stay away from fruit forever. I'd not heard that before but was curious if that was something others had been told?"
"Well it happened, honestly Iâ€™m conflicted part of me is upset another part doesnâ€™t care because if you truly cared for me I donâ€™t think this would be and issue. We talked about this and you didnâ€™t go in blind.",
Surgery on 1/30 and the gas pain is killing me!,"The gas seems to have settled in my shoulders/neck and dear God it hurts! I also keep burping a ton and every time I burp it feels like I'm going to puke. Anyone have any advise? I was seriously hoping I would be one of the people with no issues and no pain, but I'm not so lucky. This freaking sucks and I'm feeling pretty miserable. "
Question... My pre-op instructions say not to let my pets sleep in my bed with me prior to or post surgery.,Have any of you done this post surgery and experienced issues? My dog sleeps with us every night so if I need to get her a crate I'd like to do that now instead of later.
How did you explain your absence from work?,"Hi all. So I've decided that I'm not going to tell anyone at work about my surgery. I'm a private person and feel it's nobody else's business. I'm at a loss as to explain why I'm taking 2-4 weeks off of work. My work is very gossippy and I'm worried that if I take that unexplained time off then start losing weight, people will start figuring it out. I also need to tell my manager something, obviously. 

For those keeping their surgery to themselves, how did you handle this?  I've heard of some people saying they had gallbladder surgery. 

Also when did you tell your boss?

Thanks!!"
2 questions,"1. I've been in a stall since 2 weeks post op (VSG) . I'll be 4 weeks post op in one week and I have my check in with my doctor. Ill be so embarrassed if I didn't lose anything. Anyone else experience this this soon into the weight loss process?

2. Poops!  Maybe TMI, but how often do you poop now post op? I poop wayyyy less than I used to and not sure if I should be concerned. 

Thankssssss"
Some thoughts on stalls,"First, let me say: this is not a request for sympathy. Yes, I'm currently stalled out; yes, it's frustrating. But I am well aware that this is just part of the show, and as long as all my inputs are in order, there's really nothing for it but to wait. 

But I've been thinking about this phenomenon, and I'm wondering if anyone else can relate to this:

The lack of movement on the scale is irritating, no question. I like drops, I want to see more drops! But I also feel like that's not what's bothering me the most about this. 

My whole life, I've been overweight. And the message I've gotten from society, from doctors and nurses, from the media is that I need to take responsibility for my weight problems and get it under control. 

And now I'm here, 4.5 months out from surgery, and I am without question the most in control of my eating, my exercise, and my health that I have ever been in my life. 

And *still* I can't actually control what my weight is. I am still, at least some of the time, powerless over whatever obscure functions and processes my body undertakes. Because if I could actually, directly control my weight, *I wouldn't be in week 3 of a frustrating fucking stall.* The results don't match the effort, and there's probably nothing more I can do to change the situation. 

I think that's what really eats at me."
Appetite Suppressants,"I'm 9 months post-RNY, and over the past few months I've greatly upped my exercise. While I've raised my calorie goal reasonably to support the change, and really love my gym mornings, it's had a very noticeable side effect -- I am now ravenously hungry. All day. 

I've tried moving my protein shakes around. Eating more filling food. Switching to smaller meals and snacks throughout the day. Nothing really seems to help. Considering that and the fact that my body is an idiot, I plan to discuss the situation with my doctor and see if she can put me on an appetite suppressant of some sort. 

Since medications can have a different effect after surgery, I'm just wondering if anyone else has any experience with appetite suppressants after surgery. I'd like to hear how it worked out for you, or what you might recommend."
Who works for a national company that covers WLS? Can we make a list? I have heard Starbucks and Costco cover WLS. Who else?,
Thick salvia still at 9 months out,"I am down 90 lbs and 5 lbs away from my goal weight ( I am very short). However, I still need to drink hot beverages (even just hot water) else I get thick muscous/salvia. It still can make me gag/puke.

I get it if I eat without having a hot beverage first. Is this going to be forever? It is hard to get hot liquids when I am out and about.. I dont want to order beverages at restaurants since then I have to wait so long to eat."
My vsg surgery is tomorrow and Iâ€™m all of a sudden getting super nervous.,"Iâ€™ve been been looking forward to this day for over 9 months now, and throughout this pre op journey Iâ€™ve been nothing but extremely excited to change my life for the better and now that itâ€™s actually here Iâ€™m nervous out of my mind. I have to constantly remind myself to not be scared, itâ€™ll be worth it, and that Iâ€™ve been working for this for 9 months now. Ahhhh the nerves are hitting and I was completely fine until like 3 hours ago. Have any of yâ€™all been through the same thing?


Update:
Thank you guys for all of the encouragement! Yâ€™all have no idea how much your words have helped me. Iâ€™m headed to the hospital rn and Iâ€™m feeling significantly less nervous. Iâ€™m so excited for my life to change!"

A non-scale victory I never thought I would actually see,"I had my surgery on July 17, 2018. I weighed 274 lbs the day of surgery. I now weigh 178, and I have some way to go as I am not tall. Despite getting to onderland for the first time in my adult life, I still feel like a fat girl. 

Yesterday my brother, who has been a huge support and never approached any of it with judgment, took me shopping. He convinced my to go to Uniqlo, a store I have never been to because they never carried my size or even close back when I was wearing a 26. He encouraged me to try, so I grabbed a few XLs to try on. 

They were too big, guys. I have never had to size down in a straight size store. The few times I could even fit anything, it was always the largest size. I left with a shirt and pants in size large, and one shirt in a medium. I bought a dress from h&amp;m without trying it on in an xl. I had to exchange that for a medium too. Another dress I bought is a 10, and it fits me today. I bought it as a goal item without trying it on, only to find that it fits me already.. 

Iâ€™m still not where I want to be, but people donâ€™t look at me and see fat first anymore. I can shop in any store without feeling out of place or relegating myself to the shoe section. I donâ€™t even know what to do with myself now. Itâ€™s exciting and emotional to finally not be shopping in the plus size section of any store. "
Every Mexico facility seems a little sketchy: Thoughts?,"I'm pursuing WLS surgery in Mexico since I don't have 20k to spend of WLS in the US, but every one of the prominent WLS clinics catering to medical tourists is throwing up at least one red flag.  
OCC and Dr. Ariel Ortiz: he has the certifications and accreditation, but directed people with lap bands to an unlicensed and unqualified group of people for maintenance, leading to many complications and at least one death.  Furthermore the person who responded to my submission of medical information kept referring to the Dr. Ortiz as "" the leading bariatric surgeon"" as though she had a quota for the number of times to mention him.  
LIMARP: Accredited by the American College of Surgeons, but contact with them is not inspiring confidence.  Their website is amateurish, documents sent to me contained misspellings, and the online form submission had some fields using Spanish instead of English  
A Lighter Me - Dr Elias Ortiz: His profile proudly states he was featured as a ""2015 Premier Surgeon"" by Newsweek.  However, if you look at the article, it is ""Sponsor Insight,"" effectively and advertisement dressed up as an article.  
There are others but the situation is the same: there is always something sloppy or concerning about how they present themselves.  
If you had surgery in Mexico, did you notice things like these and decided to go ahead?  What factors were important to you in selecting who performed WLS on you?"
About time. It has a slightly different texture and taste but it's significantly cheaper.,
Advice please! Changing jobs 1 month pre-op?,"I recently received an awesome job offer.. If I accept, it would mean starting my new position June 1. I'm currently scheduled for surgery July 2, and start my liquid diet June 18. Will I survive? Or should I decline? I am really hesitant to move into a new job (an incredibly busy job) and have to adapt to a new job, people, environment,etc  while on the liquid diet. I've toyed with the idea of postponing the surgery, but I've been going through the process for literally a YEAR! (Yay, Kaiser!) I really don't want to postpone. Thoughts?

Edit- they are already aware I will be out for the month of July for a medical procedure."

Dumping question,"So I just experienced dumping for the first time (so glad I didn't trust that ""fart""). I'm supposed to be eating full liquids, but I went for a runny instant potato cup for dinner. I didn't measure how much I ate, I just stopped when I felt full. Which was too much, because I immediately started getting a stomach ache. I drank a little water hoping to thin it out and the stomach ache shortly passed. Then a bit later I got bubble guts and knew what was coming next. I can't believe how quickly that went through me!

I know I made a poor choice. I was just wondering if anyone can tell me what exactly caused it, the consistency, the carbs, or the amount? Or was it all of the above making the perfect storm?"
Pat down at the airport?,So ever since I had rny every time I fly they select me for the pat down. I still have my excess skin and apparently in their scan machines it looks like I have something strapped to my body. Does this happen to anyone else?

***TL;DR: Change is hard.. and wls results in a lot of changes, and not a lot of time to get comfortable before more changes show up. Who said this was the 'easy' way?***

---

I had my surgery just ~4 months ago. Recent enough that it honestly seems like it's been just a few weeks, and long ago enough that I'm starting to overcome my brain's insistence that nothing has changed, and I am actually starting to see some of the changes that others have been for some time, at least, around the edges.

I don't see changes in the mirror, possibly due to my lifelong battle with Body Dysmorphic Disorder.  I still see the same face in the mirror, and can't get much past that.  And yet, in fleeting glances, I can catch the merest glimpse that something is not the same.

But my body is changing. Without the mirror, I can see that my wrists seem longer, my forearms looser, my upper arms *feel* different. My thighs, looking down, are much smaller, my belly narrower. The skin is less firmly packed, more smooshable. Laying in bed, my belly has changed so much, and I can feel where my ribcage ends. I feel a difference when I touch my face. And yes, my clothes fit differently.

I've had to buy new pants.. because I was swimming in the old ones. It's been a trip, knowing in my head that this process hasn't stopped. Knowing that soon enough, these new pants won't fit either. Thrift stores... shop at thrift stores!

[I chart my weight](https://i.imgur.com/RVPHH2i.png), hoping to hit a number that would give me a 'normal' BMI.. knowing that that line, falling every week, will eventually curve and slow.. but seeing that it still hasn't even hinted at doing so... 

The charts tell me I am not done seeing changes, and they're not showing signs of even slowing down.

MyFitnessPal informs me that recently I passed the half-way point between my highest recorded weight and my goal weight. And in fact that I'm getting very close to the halfway point between my weight on the day of surgery, and my goal weight as well.

I should be excited.. celebrating. And yet what I feel is more like.. fear. No, not quite fear, but uneasiness.

Each milestone comes with a need to adapt, and a fear of.. leaning-in too much. Getting too comfortable, thinking I could never go back to where I was.

Gotta get new clothes? And yet I don't want to let go of the old ones.. not due to some emotional nostalgia, some deep connection to those clothes. It's only been a few weeks, right?

What if I need them again?

This emotion came to a head today as I realized one of the new pairs of pants was loose, and could already use a belt. I snatched up my homemade latigo belt, threaded it through the loops, and pulled it snug. And then I realized that the tail-end of the belt was now long enough to go through two belt loops and still hang down. I'm running out of holes on this belt that I made. I was running out in the opposite direction when I weighed in at my highest, and now I'm closing in on the last holes on the other end.

Sure, I can make more holes.. I can even cut that tail off. But what if I need it to be longer someday? 

That latigo strap was expensive, I mean, not *THAT* expensive, but it cost money. And while it's served me for over 15 years.. there's a part of me that's afraid to commit to cutting it, just in case.

It has been such a short time since the surgery. It feels so new, and I never seem to have a chance to 'get used' to being this new size, before I'm another new size. My life's history has taught me that anything can be taken away.. and while I am firmly resolute in my decision to eat well and to not do things to sabotage myself.. it feels like somehow, something outside my control could take it all away.

For now, I mean it's just a belt. I can tuck the tail into my pocket and forget about it. And when I feel more confident I can whip out the scissors and make quick work of it.. or even not.

I'm reaching the point where I should consider switching to the sizes-down shirts that I have acquired. And perhaps it's time to start putting my super loose clothes into a box. As it is, I need to buy some smaller underwear. (how crazy is that?)

I know there are more changes coming.. and it's scary in a way. I've never lost more than 20lbs on my own.. I've NEVER had to experience this before. Parts of my mind would like a break from the changes.. just stop losing for a while and get used to all this before starting up again. 

But that's not how this works.. and there's no frikking way that am I going to do anything that threatens my progress. That part of my mind will just have to learn to cope.

It sure is something tho.

How long does it take to get approved/a date?,"Hey guys, I have an initial consultation meeting with the doctor on this upcoming Wednesday, Jan. 16. I know my insurance does not require me to do a 6 month pre-op diet, therefore I just have to complete a psychiatric evaluation and other tests they would like me to run before sending it off to the insurance company. I would really love to get my surgery as soon as possible, but I donâ€™t know what to expect time wise. About how long is the process? How long after getting tests/evaluations done does it take to get a date? Trying to get an idea of when I could expect to get the surgery!"
Going on a trip - looking for tips on finding food I can eat.,"Background: gastric sleeve 05/13/19, so I'm 11 weeks out. I'm pretty much eating normally but per my surgeon cannot eat raw veggies or red meat until month three. 

I'm going on a trip this weekend and am having some anxiety about finding foods I can eat. I'm flying from buffalo to Chicago, and am going with a large group of girl friends so majority will go as far as choosing restaurants to eat at. The majority want to eat Chicago type food such as deep dish pizza, which is a no-go for me. Any advice on finding healthy things to eat at not-so healthy restaurants?  I haven't eaten out yet post surgery so I don't know what all you can ask for off menu. Like if they offer a grilled chicken sandwich I can just order the grilled chicken, right?  

I plan on getting groceries while there so I'll have my protein shakes, bars, yogurts, cheese, and sliced turkey. 

Also, any restaurants anyone can recommend in the Chicago area that I can order grubhub from and get something healthy?  I might just end up cooking up some chicken and veggies but it'd be nice to not have to bother with that. 

Thanks so much!!"

Food journaling,"I feel weak. 

I have not been food journaling the way I should, skipping days altogether and then justifying myself to eat like crap. 

I have narrowed down the two reasons I am eating/avoiding journaling  like this. 

1. My dad is/has been sick my entire teenage/ young adult life. Complications from diabetes. Lost a leg, end stage renal failure, couple heart attackâ€™s. You name it, itâ€™s happened. Well, heâ€™s been having complications with his good leg for the better part of two years. His balance is deteriorating. Heâ€™s taken two really bad falls the past couple weeks, which has landed him in a short term rehab facility.  Itâ€™s super stressful, my mom is fed up with him (frankly me too, heâ€™s pissed that heâ€™s in the rehab center and told me â€œno one wants to take care of me so I guess this is where I need to beâ€) so I am emotionally eating because thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve always done. And itâ€™s even worse this time because itâ€™s like I tell myself â€œokay, this is your last meal Iâ€™m serious this time this is it. 

2nd reason. Itâ€™s a holiday weekend, my moms birthday, and weâ€™re celebrating. So thereâ€™s all kinds of delicious foods that is already made so why waste it, and cook my own meals? Iâ€™ll start tomorrow I tell myself as I have a second helping of birthday cake. 

Itâ€™s so fucked up that I sabotage myself. My weakness is fast food. I will get fast food as often as I can. Itâ€™s an addiction. 

I KNOW I want to do the surgery. Itâ€™s what I want, and Iâ€™m just struggling to follow the dietary planning. I KNOW I need it to prove that I can handle the surgery. I know surgery isnâ€™t a â€œquick-fixâ€  I get all that but itâ€™s still fucking so hard. 

Am I fucking this up for myself? 

Side note: I ordered meals from a local company that cooks healthy meals to aid with weight loss. I am too lazy to cook rn and they are pretty convenient. Now I just need to actually eat them instead of looking around and seeing what everyone else is eating. 

Again Iâ€™m sorry if my postings kind of are a rant/ make no sense, it just helps for me to put it out there sometimes. Thanks for listening."

Sleeping on your back?,"Post op- do you have to sleep on your back? I'm having surgery soon but I CANNOT sleep on my back because I experience sleep paralysis when I do this, it's no joke. I know it sounds crazy but I would rather feel physical pain than sleep on my back.

Edit: Thank you for the clarification!"
Is this a gallbladder attack or dumping?,"Hi all, 

I had a sleeve ten months ago, I'm down 100 pounds. 

Yesterday was my kid's birthday. He wanted milkshakes for his birthday, so we went and got milkshakes. Not something I'd usually indulge in (if I crave ice cream, I usually have a sugar free popsicle or a yasso frozen yogurt bar), but I figured once wouldn't be a big deal.  

We get home, and I get a pain in my side just below my ribs.  It's not bad pain, I can just feel it, it's kind of like a pulled muscle. Then, I have to run to the bathroom with massive diarrhea. Then, a pain in my right shoulder. (WTF?) Then, more diarrhea. I crawl into bed thinking I'll be ok in the morning. 

Morning comes around, and the pain on my right is still there (still only at about a 2 on a scale of 1-10, so not a big deal), and I've still got the shits. Could this be dumping? Or a gallbladder attack? I thought dumping was usually over in a few hours, and that gallbladder attacks are usually very painful, but this doesn't really fit into either of those buckets. And I don't think it's a stomach bug because I feel fine other than this. I've got a call into my doctor but I'm not sure when he will get back to me. "
Starting to feel like my attempt for this is failing.,"I just need to vent- I am limited on the time I have available in order to get surgery done with insurance coverage. After July 31st, I only have state medicaid until the marketplace reopens and my surgeon is not in my state. 

Due to insurance issues and timing, I requested a surgery date of 7/9. Due to the procedure (BPD/DS), equipment necessary for it and when they have access to it the closest date would be 7/10.  

Surgeon has (according to surgical coordinator) supposed to have been going over my chart and deciding whether or not ""I'm ready"" (I had my initial consult 6/3/19, go all my reqs done by 6/15) since last Wednesday. I got an email from her saying he would be going over my chart and I *should* have an answer Monday 6/24. 4pm, 6/24 comes around and nothing. At this point I was unaware that 7/9 wouldn't be possible. I called at 4pm, was told they were super busy due to people taking vacation time. *Should* have an answer tomorrow (Tuesday, 6/25).

It's now 6/26 and I haven't heard anything. I know they're probably just really busy and understaffed. I *get* it. But with only a couple weeks until that date, I feel like it should be some sort of priority (even tho I know it's probably lower on this priority list for good reason). I don't want to keep emailing her, and I don't know how to even start an email to the surgeon about it. 

Every time I talk to her she seems like she doesn't think it should be a problem to schedule that soon, but surgeon needs to give his okay in order for the pre-op process to start (including submitting to insurance for approval) and says she keeps stressing the importance of a decision to the surgeon due to pre-op diet and clearances needed. 

Meanwhile I have started the pre-op diet on my own (I got guidelines from her about it and figure that it can't hurt to do it even if surgery won't happen), but that's the only thing I really can do (aside from nagging). 

I'm just feeling like what once had a very positive outlook has switched to being totally impossible- at least for now. And the fact that I've spent soo much money on pre-op testing for it to possibly be for nothing is killer. 

Sorry for the rant."

Just had my last appointment,"After 5 months of appointments, I finally passed my programs and insurances requirements, just gotta get approval from my insurance and get a surgery date! 


I canâ€™t describe how excited I am!! "
Is it possible to NOT lose?,"I am like 7 weeks post op and Iâ€™ve been dealing with a stall for almost two weeks and itâ€™s making me feel worried like I am the first medical mystery case that didnâ€™t lose weight. My dietician told me not to count and to just eat consciously and thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been doing. 
Protein first and almost no carbs because I donâ€™t even have the room after the protein. Granted, I am not exercising like I should but not losing doesnâ€™t make sense looking at how little I can eat."
Saying goodbye to the old you,"I started at 245, 227 the day of surgery, April 1st, 197 today.  While Iâ€™m happy to get to know my new body as it changes, nobody told me Iâ€™d ever mourn the old me. Saying goodbye to my biggest, comfiest clothes that hid me when I needed them is sad. I wonâ€™t miss her, but I am a little sad saying goodbye to parts of the old me.  Anyone else ever feel sad??"
I cried over a cancelled appointment today (Vent),"I have the lovely combo of sleep apnea, very high blood pressure (controlled with 2 meds) and asthma. My pulmonologist was like â€œyou HAVE to lose weight.â€ Believe me, sir, I want to. I can accept myself but society will never accept me. Iâ€™ve heard it said a bunch of different â€œniceâ€ ways but my weight is holding me back. 

I have Kaiser Colorado. I weigh 230 and Iâ€™m 5â€™6.â€ With two co-morbidities I finally qualify for surgery. I say â€œfinallyâ€ because over the last 5 years Iâ€™ve gained and lost 60 lbs over and over only to end up bigger than where I started.

Three months ago when my PCP agreed to refer me for surgery I was thrilled, relieved. I talked to my husband who was less than supportive of the idea. Heâ€™s naturally thin. He loves me the way that I am. Surgery makes him nervous. (Give me any tips you have!) 

But the boiler broke and all of the appointments for my clinic are canceled tomorrow and I needed to be rescheduled. I gave the clinic coordinator the two year history of me trying to make it into the clinic. Two years ago Kaiser told me that if I took a class about their programs they would get me in more quickly. I took the class 3 months later. My first appointment with the nurse practitioner was 6 months after that. She complemented me on my food log, my consistent exercise habits, my dedication but said she couldnâ€™t do anything for me. I canâ€™t tolerate phentermine. Thereâ€™s nothing left for me. I kept trying to get an MD appointment but I had lost the weight, so no dice, and now Iâ€™ve unfortunately gained it back.

I know how to white-knuckle it. How to be on a liquid diet. I know the amount of calories in everything. I want to put in the time and effort and make a big change but Iâ€™m so sick and tired of my biology fighting me every step of the way. I want one *real* tool in my toolkit besides fragile â€œwillpower.â€ 

My husband overheard this whole conversation and complimented me. I was â€œvery nice and politeâ€ but stood up for myself. Heâ€™s proud. 


I am rescheduled for Tuesday. The clinic snuck me in! I canâ€™t help but cry, though. This journey is so long and so frustrating. I just want to be in surgery right now. 

Thanks for letting me vent. I figured if anyone understood itâ€™s the people here. 



"
Time for the waiting game!,"I completed my final clearance with nutrition last week and I got confirmation today that the surgeonâ€™s office submitted me to insurance (VSG). The insurance company says it takes 15 days to process when they have all of the info they need, so if they have to call the surgeonâ€™s office for additional info, the 15 days starts over. Kind of a drag because I have zero control over what was submitted. After the surgeonâ€™s office receives approval, theyâ€™re booking 6 weeks out. Tick tock!!

Fingers crossed I can have a little turkey and mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving!!

Meanwhile Iâ€™m just trying to stick to my healthy meal plans, practicing sipping my water, tracking my food, etc. Iâ€™ve stepped up my walking game but that seems to be making me hungrier.

I have learned that I am not a patient person. Not even a little bit lol.

Oh well. Happy Friday, everybody!"

Can I wear a bra after my surgery?,"Hi

Having RNY keyhole surgery on 29th of April. Is it too painful to wear a bra afterwards? If so for how long?

I hate not wearing a bra!"
Sleeved over 3 years ago but weight is creeping back up. Suggestions please!,
Tried beer for the first time a year after surgery,"Decided I would try beer again because I liked the taste before surgery. Went to a close bar with a friend to be a designated driver just Incase it hit me bad.

3/4 through the first beer, I felt a light buzz and was pleasantly surprised. The buzz kind of went away by the time a second came, along with the coming down feeling.

The process repeated itself through 4 beers.

I was taking a little less than an hour per drink and pouring it into a glass to get some of the carbonation out.

I burped a lot, as would be expected.

I donâ€™t think I could have maintained a pace to keep the buzz up. I think thatâ€™s where the alcoholism issue would stem from in wls patients. Itâ€™s like a night of light drinking in each beer. Youâ€™d have to put s lot away and fast to have a lasting significant effect. At the end of my adventure, I had the stumbling issues without the slower reaction time. It was pretty weird.

In the end, I know I can have a beer or two here and there but the old days of tying one on is gone and thatâ€™s fine with me. I was needing ten or so each time I went out.

Just thought Iâ€™d share to let people thinking about it know what my experience was. Be careful if youâ€™re going to try it."
Average/Expected Loss Chart?,"I thought I saved the post, but I remember seeing a chart here posted in a comment that had starting weights and average weight loss for each over (I think) the first year. Does anyone remember it and have it? I have searched and can't find it."

Dehydration is no joke.,"Hey all. Just want you to learn from my mistake. 
I drink my water every day. Always the 64 oz or more. 
But today was a bad day for me. Lots of crappy things happened and I did not think of drinking. 
I was fine all day and at 6:30pm I noticed I had nothing to drink yet so I got up and H E L L O!!!! ï¿½ï¿½
Extremely dizzy. Almost had to throw up from vertigo. Tried to lie down and the ceiling was spinning. I suspected this must be dehydration. So I started to drink. But it took 2 hours till the dizziness went away. My urine was dark. 
I drank 64 oz in those 2 hours. Next urine was light again. 

If this had not happened at home, I would have been screwed. That was unexpected. Just one day without enough water. Not too little water over time but just a few hours late with drinking. 

Learn from my mistakes. Always drink something. Have water with you at all times."
First World WLS Problem,"How to stay hydrated today, yet not have to leave to use the bathroom during Avengers Endgame! :-D"
I wish I could date someone who had WLS.,"I really wish there were some singles events for people who have had some type of WLS. I feel like I have so many insecurities about how I eat and how my body looks. Being with someone who â€œgets itâ€ would just be amazing. I have never been in a serious relationship and Iâ€™m 28, which honestly boils down to low self confidence and self loathing. Now sprinkle in some body dysmorphia and I just donâ€™t have any idea how to confidently navigate a new relationship with a man, let alone feel confident that someone is interested in me.

I feel like Iâ€™m starting to have some semblance of a new found confidence but I donâ€™t know how to express it and I feel like any normal person would be turned off by the way I look.

I just want a bariatric man lol. I donâ€™t know if the support group my program runs would be too happy if I used the meetings to prowl for men lol."
How do you increase protein intake/Maintain your protein intake?,"I've had my sleeve 2 months ago. I've noticed that i have lost a significant amount of my strength. I'm talking about i can't even arm wrestle a 14 year old any more. I used to be able to bench 450Lbs, but i haven't been weight lifting since the surgery for recovery.   


I've been very light on my doctors notes, and I've tried my best to maintain a steady protein intake. My average is around 20Gs a day. 

&amp;#x200B;

How can i increase that? I would like to not lose any more strength. Shakes are simply too large. I thought about eating powder directly. I never get hungry and have to force myself to eat something. So drinking 16oz of water is v difficult. I drink about 6 cups a water but through small sips.   


I've tried doing the same with shakes but i just simply can't do it. What do you guys do for protein intake?  


At the moment i'm going to try to eat one Protein bar (20g) + 2 Protein Shakes a day (30G Each) That should put me at 80G a day. I would like your tips/tricks or if you have a certain product you use that's concentrated/goes down easier. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"

Anyone's eyes change color after wls?,"I used to have very dark brown eyes.  I hadn't even noticed until someone pointed it out that my eyes are now a MUCH lighter color....probably a hazel, but almost green.  I did call my eye doctor, and was told it can happen with dietary and health changes, or could be just from aging.  He did not seem concerned at all, but since I'm overdue for an exam, I scheduled an appointment.  

I don't really care that they changed color...it just seems weird, and I'm curious if it happened to others.

edit -  I had my 1yr followup in November, and all labs were perfect.  ALL labs since surgery have been perfect.  I take my vitamins daily, never miss them.  I feel great, no energy problems or anything like that.  If the eye Dr. says anything other than ""totally normal"", then I'll probably call the surgeon's office just to be extra cautious."
So tired,"I am so tired randomly. Like I just ate a Lean Cusine Pizza and I needed to lay down.

And nearly everyday at 1:30-2:30 after lunch around 11:30pm this happens, too.  I get crazy tired, queasy, and have to lay down.

And when I do events - I make it 'till 2:30 and then everything crumbles.  I get tired, disoriented, and I have to gather every bit of strength I have to finish the day. Then I am sick for at least 24 hours.

My nutritionist has me on normal foods in normal portions. My stomach can fit half of what she wants.  She assures me if I eat a balanced diet I will feel better and have a better relationship with food.

Btw I take the right vitamins and my last blood work was fine.  I am also trying to get more exercise in

Is anyone else tired all the time?

I am trying to find a new job and I can't if I cannot stay awake or feel awful.

No liquid only pre-op diet?,"I am surprisingly a little bummed that my program doesn't do a liquid pre-op diet. They said it's unnecessary. I am just supposed to eat low carb and low fat in the months before surgery, and then I have a one day transition of low carb breakfast to full liquid lunch to clear liquid dinner the day before surgery. I was hoping to be forced to lose 10-15 pounds before surgery. And I'm not super successful at eating low carb (I wouldn't need surgery if I was, right?) so I'm worried I won't actually shrink my liver much. Anyone else have a similar pre-op diet and do ok?"

Starting weights to current weight!,"Hello everyone! I am currently sitting at 275 lbs which is 100 over weight according to my surgeon which is also what Iâ€™m projected to loose. I am 4 months into my 6 month primary care physician monitored diet which is going well. I am having my EGD on the 30th and have done a lot of the preliminary stuff. I (hopefully!) will be having my surgery in December in between my semesters. 
All of your pictures are so encouraging and makes me even more and more excited to have surgery and happy I am making this decision.
Would you all be able to share with me your before and after weights? I would love to compare just to get a feel of things. Also what WLS you had. Iâ€™m having a sleeve.

Also any post surgery diet tips and meals would be great. I would like to get an idea of how to get the amount of protein Iâ€™m suppose to have and what doâ€™s and donâ€™ts are.

Thanks all! XOXO"

Must haves for when you get home from the hospital list,"Hi there, everyone is always here asking what to pack for the hospital, but what about right when you get home? Can we make a list of stuff you need on day 3 post-op?

These are the things I personally needed for my husband after VSG surgery when we got home from the hospital for two weeks until we started phase III.

Amazon:

Tiny 2 oz cups plastic for drinks and

 4 oz plastic cups for food items like yogurt, cream of wheat, etc.

Bariatric cook book from Amazon to give you hope and guidance.

Pyrex 8 oz microwavable glass cup for everything 

Food scale

Strainer wire mesh (strained soups)

A water bottle with the Ounces and Time on them to meet water goals by certain time 

Crocks or some shoes that slip on easily for taking walks.

Luxury item: a Fitbit to track your resting heart rate because a heart rate greater than 120 beats per min can be a sign of a gastric leak.




Walgreens or drug store:

Gas-x chewables for when the gas moves from your abdomen/shoulder into your digestive tract on day three/four and it's all floating around with no where to go. Chew a  gas-x thirty times and swallow. Repeat again a little while later if needed. Will start farting.

Miralax for mixing into drinks for the first few days post op.

Thermometer for checking your temperature when you leave the hospital to make sure you don't have a fever (sign of gastric leak)

Gauze and waterproof tape from the drug store to change the dressing on your wounds.

I bought an enema and gloves and ky jelly in case I have a big hard impacted poop but I'm praying I don't with all the miralax 1x per day.




Grocery store:

Plastic spoons to eat the yogurt, cream of wheat, etc.

Lactose free milk 0% fat (Lactaid)

Cream of wheat (water down with milk)

Gatorade zero, water, Powerade zero, non-carbonated sugar free drinks.

Protein shake you like

Cream soups low fat (you need to strain them) the best creamy soups I found were from ""Imagine"" sold at Walmart/Kroger.

0% fat broth

0% fat Greek yogurt (water down with milk) the best yogurt I found was Dannon triple 0

V8 vegetable juice (no added sugar)

Stevia 

Sugar free pudding and Jell-O (I refuse to eat any of this crap because it hurts my tummy)



What else did I miss?

Edit: My first gold thank you so much! I just wanted to help this community a fraction of how much they've helped me."

Exploring WLS - Need Guidance,"Hello All,

First time on the group. I need some advise and guidance. (Sorry for lengthy post, but hope it helps build context)

**Profile:** 38M, 5ft 7in, 275Lbs,

**Activity level:** fairly active (3 days a week cross-fit/HIIT training) but otherwise sedentary job (computers).

**Body Type:** Fairly athletic with heavy belly fat (imagine a paunchy strong wrestler.. :) )

**Medical:** No health issues (lipid panel, glucose panel, etc are all within acceptable ranges over last 7 years) Just sleep apnea for which I use CPAP machine.

**Diet:** Vegetarian (No Fish, No Chicken, No Red Meat, No Eggs)

**Background:** 1.5 years ago, post my physical my doctor recommended I undergo WLS as I was 100 lbs over my ideal weight and would qualify. I dismissed the idea as I believe that the Height/Weight ratio does not take into account muscle mass, bones weight etc. I believe as I don't have any medical condition, there is no need for such drastic step. I could up my gym and focus harder on diet. Historically I focus on my diet and I loose weight, but I fall off the wagon post 3 weeks. I have been falling off consistently. There is clearly a need for me to do something about my weight for improving my mobility, want to workout more (explore areas in weightlifting that I haven't, wanna run a 5K to begin with and see how far I can go.

**What Changed:**

This time around, I have been reading up more and more on WLS and this forum has been a big help.

My mindset is that:

* I have been consistent at the gym for cross-fit for last 2 years. I genuinely enjoy it and I am a competitive fellow.
* I am healthy right now and it might be better to undergo now than wait for a medical condition to develop
* This surgery will help me move my 5 year average weight point (270lbs) down drastically to about 200-210. That will allow me to do focus more on my health/workouts
* Ofcourse looking good and being able to shop clothes in stores that I desire is an added bonus.

**ASK FROM THE GROUP:**

* Is my motivation/thought process/rationale appropriate?
* Do you have any resources on hospital/surgeon selection?
* Any recommendations in Boston area? Anyone has had personal experience in Boston area?
* How do you deal with loose skin?

Thanks in Advance!!"
Advice on what to tell coworkers?,"I work for a small business, where everyone is pretty tightly knit. Everyone gets along pretty well, and our boss is amazing. I haven't been given a surgery date yet, but I am nervous that it will be sometime this summer. Summer is the BUSIEST time of year for us (think phones ringing off the hook, customers ordering like crazy, and us employees having to work long hours to get everything done.) I am trying to picture how to tell my boss that I will need time off because I will be having surgery. I feel like I have to tell a white lie and say it's something other than wls because I feel if I'm honest, there could be a chance that I could be talked into pushing my surgery date to a more convenient time of year. I almost feel like I have to make it something sudden and justifiable. I don't feel that my decision to have wls would be seen as ideal during the busy season, even though for my own life it would really be ideal. I know I could just say that I need to have surgery and would prefer not to go into detail, but my boss would be too concerned that I'm okay and that would make me want to disclose the nature of it. I just really prefer to keep my wls to myself for my own reasons, so I am struggling with what to say for being out for two to four weeks of the summer. Anyone have any ideas? "

"Old Navy, WHERE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!","So growing up, I was never able to shop at Old Navy cause I was 300+lbs since middle school. I'm 3 years post VSG, over 190lbs down and I JUST walked into an Old Navy for the first time last week. I bought a bunch of dresses and shorts cause they had a sale and some stuff for my boyfriend and the most COMFORTABLE socks ever. 

But I really liked their rage of sizes. I got an XL kinda tshirt material sun dress and I could definitely do a L (I'm between 16w-20w depending where I shop. Used to be 28w-32w). But my point is if you guys are looking for some clothes to buy while you are going down in sizes, check out Old Navy!"

This morning I was 190.4. My surgeon thought that's about where I would end up long term so I'm pretty happy with it so far! I'm officially overweight and not obese which amazes me.

"5 weeks out, not doing anything wrong but pain fully slow weight loss since week 2","I was sleeved 6/3. I lost 15 pounds the first two weeks which was great but then my weight loss slowed to almost nothing.

Week 3 weigh in: 1 pound, did lose inches

Week 4 weight in: 2 pound, no inches lost

Week 5 weight in: 1 pound, no inches lost.

I thought maybe instead of a 3 week stall I was getting a 3 week slow down and surely it would end soon. Yet every time I've asked for advice on if this is normal I've basically been blamed and had it implied that I must be doing something wrong. Just like when I struggled to lose weight pre surgery. Pre surgery I had people actually tell me things like spinach and bell peppers were stalling me. 

I am using a food scale. measuring spoons and measuring cups for everything.

I am following my nutritionists plan other than not eating all the fruit, cream of wheat and crackers the plan says I can have. I don't have room for those foods.

I am drinking 60 oz of water a day.

I am getting in 50-60g of protein each day. 

I am not eating too many calories. Averaging 400-500 a day. Had someone in another bariatric group suggest I cut calories.

I am not eating too many carbs. Carbs are well under 20 each day. I never lost more than 1-2 pounds a week on keto.

I have been told I should eat more calories and up it to 900-1000. My nutritionist plan is to work up to 600 calories by 2 months out.  I cannot physically eat more than 500 calories per day. I have to eat 5 times a day to get that much in. I cannot eat more than that and get in my water. I am full after eating my protein so there is no room for anything else.  


I have been told the slow loss is my fault because I'm not going to a gym to work out. I went back to work last week and have next to no energy. I try to go for a walk every day.

I have PCOS so maybe that's why I'm struggling but I feel like a failure.  I had someone tell me that if I was telling the truth than my weight would be melting off when I thought it was normal for people to have a stall at this point. I'm not stalled but barely losing.

I keep hoping this will eventually pass as long as I keep doing the right things."

Has anyone else had this issue with insurance?,"My wife has been wanting wls for about 2 years now. And after her heart doctor finally recommended it were seriously searching to start the process. But I've ran into a weird insurance limbo...

So 2 months ago we had the medical coverage person come and do a presentation about our coverage and what's new for the year, blah blah. And they SAID during the presentation that they cover weight loss surgery. And that they actually are offering us to do it out of country to make it cheaper on them (all expenses paid). 

So now I start googling. Find a doctor that does it. Find that they accept my insurance (United healthcare). All is great. Until I sign onto my insurance website....... I find the wls section and it tells me the estimated cost. $35,880 OUT OF POCKET. 0% covered by my plan. 

What. The. Fuck. 

Has anyone else ran into this? My wife may be able to go through Medicaid since she had it before we got married (just got married recently) so we think shell still be able to hold it as a secondary insurance. But I have no clue. I'm waiting until business hours to call and ask (I work nights). "

Surgery was Wednesday and I feel like I am recovering too slowly,"Hi all,

So I had my vsg surgery on Wednesday and experienced the usual gas pains/nausea. I've had a really hard time maintaining the diet the dietician wants me to have- drinking 64 fluid oz per day and consume 60 g of protein. I can barely have 35-40 oz in the time that I'm awake per day and consuming all that protein through protein shakes on top of that is a joke. It probably doesn't help that I absolutely hate the artificial sweeteners that Premiere is loaded with. I can't tolerate more than a few sips before feeling like I'm going to throw up. I am ordering some unjury unflavored today because I can definitely feel that I'm not getting in enough protein and nutrients and that's definitely impacting my recovery. 

My surgeon also expected me to be able to tolerate non-chunky soups by now and there's no way. I finally got to the point where I could tolerate vegetable broth last night- actual soup seems like it's forever away. 

My weight at this point speaks for itself. I am down nearly 10 pounds since surgery. As much as I would like to believe that that's all fat, I know that's not possible and it's at least mostly water weight. 

I'm not in much pain anymore but don't feel awesome. I think I'm definitely dehydrated and given that I've only been consuming about 20-50 calories a day since Wednesday, I think my body is really tired. I've been trying so hard to get at least a few more calories in per day but I'm not even allowed to have diluted juice according to the dietician. 

Is there anything that I should be doing at this point? Did anyone experience something similar and found something that worked for them?

Declining pain medication post surgery?,"With the whole opioid crisis going on, I'm concerned about taking any pain killers after surgery, I don't need any new addictions in my life, I just fought/am still fighting food addiction.

Mental Health Leave,"TL;DR Surgery obliterated my mental health and I'm taking leave from work.

I'm dealing with losing my depression coping mechanisms - eating bad shiz - and my body looking, imho, disgusting.

I won't bore everyone with the whole story, but I just wanted to say: If you're considering surgery and you have mental health issues, please don't avoid surgery because of said issues. Just prepare, prepare, prepare! I wish I had started seeking help BEFORE it got so bad I had to take leave from work, but I still don't regret it.

Almost five weeks out - how slow are you eating?,"I'll be five weeks out on Monday. My question is how slow and how much are you/were you eating at this point?  I'm finding myself hungry a lot and I'm wondering if I'm not eating enough. When I eat my meals I was told to limit my eating to 20 minutes. So I set my timer and take a bite, chew for 30 seconds, then wait 2 minutes before my next bite. At this rate, I can get about 8-9 small bites in, I'm also using a baby spoon. I always weigh out 2 oz and can never finish that at a meal. 

I'm exceeding my protein goals but am a little short still on my water goals (I usually get 50 oz). I typically drink two protein shakes, have cottage cheese for breakfast, shredded chicken with salsa for lunch, oikos triple zero for a snack, and low sodium turkey and low fat swiss for dinner. 

After I eat I feel satisfied but then an hour later feel hungry. Sometimes I get super hungry. Is this normal?  Am I not eating enough?  I'd be fine having smaller snacks more often but it's already hard fitting in water with the 30 mins before and after rule. 

Should I not be waiting two minutes between bites?  

Any advice you guys should lend me would be great!"
Considering getting VSG.....will it make my pain go away?,"Hi all, I've just come across this subreddit and figured I'd post to get some input from others because I'm heavily considering getting the VSG done. (about 97% sure I want to do it)

&amp;#x200B;

I've been over weight all my life and no matter how much I exercise/eat healthy/count calories/etc, I've found myself at 25 years old being 237 lbs. Now My body feels as if it's deteriorating. Sciatica pains, lower back pain, Acid reflux issues, knee pain....however my PCP says I don't have any health issues like diabetes or high cholesterol. 

&amp;#x200B;

Did anyone else have these problems before undergoing WLS? Did anyone else who had pain have it go away completely or suffer less? I'm tired all the time and have horrible headaches and constantly sit at my job which also doesn't help. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I shouldn't be having all these pains at such a young age. My only concern about not getting the surgery (AKA the other 3%) is insurance. IDK if my insurance will give me the OK because my BMI is \~37%. Also once 12/31 of this year hits, I'm off my parents insurance and have to take the carrier from work and IDK if they cover the procedure. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any input would be great, thanks!"
Insurance approved my surgery!!!,"It's insane how fast this process has been. They submitted my info on Monday!!!! I meet with the surgeon on Tuesday and can schedule the surgery after that. The office staff say he books out about three weeks. I could be on the operating table mid September! 

My insurance company didn't have a wait time either. I had my initial consultation on June 25th. My instructions were complete this checklist of appointments and proceedures and we'll submit the paperwork for approval. 

It'll be under 3 months from consult to operation. It's a really good thing I've been thinking about and researching WLS for 3 years, otherwise this would be happening way too fast."
RANT,"Ohmygod. This naturally skinny bitch Iâ€™m friends with on Facebook shared that meme going around, depicting two windows, toxic pills and surgery and lifestyle change. And in front of the first window, is a line of fat people. 

That INFURIATES ME. It may have taken a surgery to get me here, but it was fucking hard and I cannot believe that people are SO SHAMEFUL AND AWFUL."
Iâ€™m feeling on top of the world after being in onederland for the first time in 10 years! VSG 11/27/18 SW: 315 CW: 194,
Today I found out I'm a Unicorn,"I had my 2nd appointment with the clinic I'm working with for WLS. My Nurse was asking about my thoughts on RNY vs DS. I was honest with her and said I've read a lot of scary things when it comes to complications, even on Reddit someone commented ""any doctor that recommends a DS is a quack"" and it scared me!
She said the reason that stigma comes with DS because it is recommended to their heaviest patients (my BMI is 56), those patients usually are smokers with a long list of preexisting conditions which could lead to a tougher recovery or complications due to their health prior to surgery. I never thought of it like that!
Because I'm the size I am now, non diabetic, with no serious health issues I AM A DAMN UNICORN! I will wear that proudly &amp; not let the fear of complications keep me from a chance at higher long term success."
Two months post op and havenâ€™t had bread in about 4 months inspired this,
Failed My Psychological Eval Today,"I had a major set back in my journey to sleeve surgery today and am looking for any advice or anyone who may have experienced anything similar. I frequent this page under my regular username but I am feeling ashamed about this whole situation and am posting this on a throwaway. :( 

I have been moving through the steps for approval for the sleeve surgery since March. I went to an information session with my surgeon, received the recommendation from my family doctor, completed the nutritionist consultation (I am exempt from the 6 months of nutrition monitoring because my BMI is 54 - 305 lbs, 5â€™3, F) completed the physical therapist assessment, completed the scope procedure with my surgeon, completed my psychological evaluation, and was going to do my labs this Friday and go to the required support group meeting through my surgeon next Wednesday. I planned to call my surgeon to schedule my pre-op appointment and submit for insurance approval after the support group meeting next week. The nutritionist indicated I have good insurance for the procedure and could anticipate insurance approval, and was hoping to schedule for June/July based on the surgeonâ€™s schedule.

The psych eval I completed included an interview with a psychologist and the completion of the MMPI 2, and a follow up appointment to go over the results of the evaluation, which I had this morning.

I felt something was wrong pretty much as soon as I sat down in her office today. She seemed kind of nervous and asked me to complete a depression survey. She tallied it and said I tallied as mild depression. She then said the steps we were completing were requirements for the insurance and she needed to go over the findings with me. She read her statement about our interview to me for accuracy and I confirmed everything was accurate. Then she said we needed to go over the results of the MMPI 2.

She said my results indicated validity and honesty and all of the other areas were within range from the standard result of 50, except for depression. She said it was in the high 80s and well above any of the standard tiers and my result was considered an extreme outlier, and indicated deep depression. She said the result was a surprise and kind of a shock to her after our interview and implied that she had been comfortable to approve me based off of the interview but was taken aback by my MMPI 2 depression result and now couldnâ€™t clear me at this time due to that. She said her recommendation will be for one to three months at least of treatment for depression before taking the evaluation for the surgery again.

 I *have* struggled with depression through my teens and adult life and have been on antidepressants twice before, but not currently. I am dependable in my employment, am taking classes to earn my next degree, am engaged to be married and have a generally â€œokayâ€ life right now, so I thought. I probably do have past trauma/grief and self esteem issues that are impacting me in a deeper sense overall, but I kind of feel that I am a â€œfunctioning depressantâ€, in that I am doing fine in my job, school, and relationships. My obesity problem goes hand in hand with my depression, as for a lot of people, and I intended to be honest on my assessment as I thought I should be. I didnâ€™t anticipate my history with depression to be a disqualifier as it is such a known side effect of obesity. I have had the idea that â€œYeah, I am probably depressed, but isnâ€™t everyone?â€ and after today, I guess I have been more depressed than most without realizing I am outside of the norm. 

So now that I am here, I did set up another therapy session with the psychologist as well as an appointment with my family doctor to discuss whether I should start antidepressants. Anyone I have talked to about the psychological eval (a friend who has had the sleeve, family members in the medical field) have acted like the psychological eval is a breeze and an easy step to get past. Even my own surgeon commented - probably not in great form, but overall just trying to imply I was a good candidate and explaining the steps I would need to complete - that the psych eval step was just to make sure that, â€œI wasnâ€™t *crazy*â€.  Now, not clearing this step, I feel like a total outlier and a weirdo with deep depression issues I have been suppressing. 

I am worried I now have a â€œred flagâ€ on me for insurance and will be more difficult to obtain approval later, even after the psychologistâ€™s recommended 1-3 months of treatment. My mom has suggested seeking a second opinion to complete the eval with someone else (this psychologist was one of four on a list recommended by my surgeon). But I donâ€™t want to make myself look like a â€œdoctor shopperâ€ to my insurance, and the portion I â€œfailedâ€ was the standardized test I completed by myself anyway, not the interview, which I donâ€™t believe could be changed by a different interpretation by a different psychologist. 

I wonder if anyone else here has experienced a psych eval denial? If so, did you obtain approval later, after receiving treatment? This sub has been such an inspirational community to me, and I hope anyone has thoughts on this, or finds solace in my story if they experience anything similar! 


TL; DR- Have completed almost all the steps for insurance approval for the sleeve. Psychologist planned on approving me after interview, but once she receiving my MMPI 2 depression result, now requires 1-3 months of depression treatment, then I must be reevaluated for surgery clearance. Similar experiences? Will I still be cleared after 1-3 months treatment, or am I â€œflaggedâ€ as a bad candidate?"
Time from Consultation to Surgery- Mexico,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I have been quietly researching WLS options over the past couple of years. I am a 35 year old male and I was devastated at my recent appointment with my PCP when I weighed in (5'8' 370 lbs).

I have an appointment for a consultation at the UCLA Medical Center and already confirmed they are in network. I have been told that my insurance will require 3 months of a doctor monitored weight loss program. I think this is ridiculous as I have done and tried every diet and have had 100 lb weight swings almost annually. 

I dont want to wait any longer. I want help and I want to get started on my journey. Being this weight is figuratively and literally killing me. I am considering Mexico as an option. I would be paying out of pocket but it is worth it to me if it means not waiting 4 months to have the procedure. 

Does anyone have information on the time from consultation to surgery for some of the more well known Mexico bases facilities are? OCC, LIMARP, endobariatric etc. 

Thanks in advance!"
About to go into my first consultation visit!,"And I'm here alone.  Honestly I'm good with it, but I do wish I had someone here for a little support today. 

My husband is behind me 100 percent and joined me at the information seminar, and my mom and the one friend I've told so far are super excited for me making this decision...but my husband is deployed now, and my mom is going through chemo so I couldnt ask her to drag herself out to this.  

It's all good, though.  I'm excited and nervous and everything else that goes along with all of the above, but I think (I hope) I've got this. ï¿½ï¿½  Wish me luck!"
"Yearly Well Visit with PCP, feeling discouraged","I had my yearly well visit with my PCP. She knows of my interest of bariatric surgery ever since my initial consult two years ago (didnâ€™t end up going through with it). Now I have another consult scheduled and she mentioned that I should try a personal trainer and that if I have surgery Iâ€™ll have to take vitamins the rest of my life. In my opinion, Iâ€™d rather take vitamins than be morbidly obesity, have hypertension, diabetes and all the other problems that go along with it. I did tell her I am planning on seeing a therapist about my eating habits through this process and sheâ€™s happy with that, but she didnâ€™t seem on board with surgery even though I qualify. Anyone regret having the surgery? Do your benefits highly out weigh the risks? Has anyone seen a clinical psychologist during their pre-op phase?"
RNY 3 weeks ago and still have extreme nausea. Anyone else experience this and what did you do?,"My surgery was on 8/2.  I've lost about 25 pounds so far (started at 235 and am now 210) but I'm really having trouble eating, and drinking to a certain extent, because I'm constantly nauseous.  Yesterday I spent 6 hours in the ER getting fluids because I'm dehydrated and by the time I got out it was 7pm, I hadn't eaten yet, and I was starving.  I actually went through McDonalds, got a cheeseburger, and ate half the patty.  That's all I had yesterday.  So far today I've had half an egg and I can't imagine right now that I'll want to eat anything else based on the way I feel.  I'm trying to choke down some Protein2O but that's even difficult.  I have a prescription for Ondansetron for the nausea but it doesn't help at all.      
    
 Did anyone else experience this?  What did you do?  How long until it gets better?  I'm approved for disability for another week but I told my boss I'd come back on Tuesday because I'm so bored.  However, with the nausea and being tired all the time I'm nervous about how it's going to be.  (I have a desk job, but it's very high stress and I typically work 10 - 12 hour days M-F and a few hours on weekends)."

A question about hiatal hernias,"I have a consult with a surgeon in September, and a physical with my new pcp in a week. I have never been diagnosed with it, but am pretty sure I have one. Occasionally feel that food or liquid just wonâ€™t go down or have to chase a bite with a drink to get it down. It is usually occurs in passing when I eat too quickly.  I did have a period for about a week that I felt like I had to burp but couldnâ€™t. I will bring it up at my physical. 
 For those who have had a hiatal hernia how did you know and how did it effect your surgery or choice of surgery? 
Thanks"

Has anyone been given a choice between surgeries or been made to switch?,"I have been on track working toward my Gastric Sleeve surgery for 3 long years now. Last week I met with a new nurse practitioner who asked if Iâ€™d thought about Bypass and asked me to consider it. I made sure they assured me I could change my mind if I decided and told them until I decide differently to put Bypass in my plan. Called today to switch back to sleeve because my research didnâ€™t set me at ease with switching. The clinic/insurance coordinator flipped out &amp; cancelled my surgery date &amp; said I needed to come in so they could explain the surgery to me because insurance already authorized it...? I told her this was not how I was promised if I changed my mind and that I wasnâ€™t going to decide to have Bypass-she said the surgeon might not give me a choice??? Does this sound bogus to anyone or has someone experienced this? Is it really up to the surgeon to deny a patient a surgery they were going to have and he approved of seemingly on a whim? Totally scared right now, so any insight is MUCH appreciated!!!"
Did having bariatric surgery impact your relationship negatively?,"Hi there, 

I'm writing an article for the Guardian newspaper in the UK. (My name is Sirin Kale - feel free to look me up.) I specialise in reporting on sensitive stories in a compassionate and in-depth way. 

I'm writing an article about how having bariatric / weight loss surgery can affect your relationships. It's pegged to a study which shows that divorce rates are higher in couples where one partner has had the surgery. I'm interested to chat with couples who have experienced issues following surgery, or people who have ended up separating from their partners. I'd prefer to speak to British people if possible, as it's a British publication, but that's not essential. 

The piece will look at how our changing bodies affect our self-image, our confidence, and consequently, our relationships. It will also look at whether providers of weight loss surgery are doing enough to educate people about the emotional and psychological impacts of the surgery - I want to raise awareness of what a profound emotional shock it can be, and how it can really impact your mental wellbeing, not always in positive ways. 

I'm on quite a tight deadline, so if you'd like to chat with me please go on ahead and reach out. My email is [sirin.kale.writer@gmail.com](mailto:sirin.kale.writer@gmail.com), or you can message me on here. Am happy to answer any questions people might have. 

(FYI I have permission to post this from the mods.)

Thanks very much

Not sure what to do.,"I had my first consult with a surgeon &amp; things went great. The only thing Iâ€™m worried about is a drug test, do they usually drug test you? (Thc is all that would be found) I have been vaping thc to help with my eye pressure &amp; it has helped tremendously &amp; I recently quit after the consult cause Iâ€™m terrified of a drug test &amp; being denied. I donâ€™t know what to do..my symptoms are back with a vengeance since I have stopped vaping. Iâ€™m also in a illegal state..good ole Texas. I didnâ€™t write on my paper that I use illigal substances, Iâ€™m embarrassed &amp; itâ€™s not something Iâ€™m comfortable disclosing to people. Iâ€™m not a recreational user &amp; im never looking to get â€œstonedâ€. It is my medicine cause glaucoma medication put me in kidney failure. Thank you for any advice you may have."

However, when Iâ€™ve tried edibles (as I usually just vape from a cartridge) I donâ€™t feel any effects. None. I thought it was the product I bought but then I  gave some to my friends and they both experienced extreme highs! Not sure if our stomachâ€™s canâ€™t absorb the THC correctly because of the surgery or if we canâ€™t digest it properly, but Iâ€™m curious if anyone else has dealt with this.


Also: Not looking for any â€œmedical adviceâ€ on using cannabis after surgery, thank you. Iâ€™ve consulted with both my doctor and my therapist."
IS THIS WHY SKINNY PEOPLE ARE COLD (wls rant but also happy idk),"Okay so Iâ€™m 106 lbs down and about 7 months since my surgery. **im always cold** ! Is this why skinnier people wear a lot of clothes in winter? I never truly understood till now. ï¿½ï¿½ 
/ends Ted talk

But in all seriousness Iâ€™m finally proud of my journey and I am working hard to keep losing weight. 

For those of you taking a similar journey remember :

- every day is a new challenge


- protein is ur friends with benefits / side girl 


- warm water &amp; protein shakes is a great option 
for those icky belly days 


- donâ€™t be afraid to be burning off those tiny extra calories by standing more, walking in place more, or stretching more often.

"Surgery tomorrow Morning, but maybe it's a mistake?","After 8 months of starting this journey to my gastric sleeve, I finally have my surgery date and no other steps to complete... but I can't shake this doubt in the back of my mind. Is this right for me? Am I making a huge mistake? 

Some backstory:
I'm 26 years old, as of this morning's Pre-admission testing 266 lbs, with a 43 BMI and no health problems. 8 months ago was my first time having health insurance as an adult and a trip to my new primary doctor's office was an introduction to the gastric sleeve. I was told I was a 'great candidate' and referred to my now bariatric doctor. I was at the time 288 lbs. 

Am I making a mistake? Am I not as a great a candidate as was originally sold, and should I do this? Based on my own wl history, losing weight isn't a problem- keeping it off and maintaining a healthy attitude towards food and hunger is. 

After a huge argument with my sister (who is also heavy, more so than me) being called 'lazy' and 'mutilating myself into bulimia', I can't help but think... am I wrong about this? Or is she taking my own wls personally? 

((Sorry for this huge text, but I'm scared and ANY guidance or support from a source i trust would we 100% appreciated!)) "
Do you eat when you're not hungry just so you can hit your protein goal?,"I just never know if I should do this. I'm 4.5 months out from surgery and still don't feel hunger most of the time. I hate eating when I'm not hungry, but I'm also in the middle of shedding hair that I would like to keep, and I need to get protein for that. 

What do you all do?"

Upcoming work conference advice s/p VSG,"Good morning! I have an upcoming work meeting in Florida where I have only met 1-2 people there in person before, and my WLS history is unknown by everyone. 

I am currently 3.5 months PO from VSG, and Iâ€™m still eating 1.5ish ozs protein about every 2-3 hours. I normally weigh out my portions on a food scale. 

Does anyone have strategies on how to help me navigate both a buffet dinner and then more formal, pre-selected dinner? Do I acknowledge my small amount of food eaten to the table? I doubt it will be a situation in which a to-go box will be made, so would you all suggest I just bring my own food/snacks? 

Lastly, I havenâ€™t had any alcohol in over a year. While I might not drink anything at the after-dinner events planned, Iâ€™ve always had a little anxiety around unknown people, so I typically use some alcohol to help me relax . However, not only have not had alcohol in eons, but Iâ€™ve also not tested the waters of alcohol after WLS. Should I try a drink or two at my house before going? I donâ€™t want to turn into Suzy Sh*tfaced in front of my colleagues. 

Thanks for so much help with providing some guidance in these upcoming situations! "

Bariatric surgery diet w/o surgery,"I'm at the point I've tried everything to no avail and my doctor has brought up surgical options.  I've been researching all weekend, and though it seems like a great long term solution, my brain still thinks of ways to get around it, such as mimicking the eating patterns of someone whose had the surgery.  Has anyone else just tried eating a couple bites of food at meal times as an alternative to surgery?"

I never realized how my weight literally weighed on my SPIRIT. I knew I would feel better, physically and emotionally, but NEVER did I expect this dramatic change in my spirit.

1.) What is the recovery time on average.  The doctor says everyone is different which I understand.  Im having surgery on a WED, is it crazy to think that I will be up to goinng back sometime the following week (5-10 days post op)

2.) How much does the surgery mess with sleep.  My sleep has been difficult due to back pain, sleep apnea, and stress.  Im getting the sleep apnea under control with a CPAP machine, but I mostly sleep upright in a recliner due to back pain. Is this something I should expect to continue, or is laying down better?

3.) What can i expect as far as recovery in the weeks after the surgery?  Is it unresonable to think that 2 weeks post op i can go back to doing things I like, say, going to a concert?

Can't Keep Anything Down and I'm Terrified,"I'm 5 days post-op from vsg/ hiatal hernia repair and am really struggling to see that light at the end of the tunnel.

Days 1 &amp; 2 went smoothly, and I was released from the hospital the afternoon of day 2 because I was getting in enough water and feeling pretty good. The very next day at home, it took a turn for the worse. I couldn't get my sips of water in without violently gagging pretty much every 20 minutes. Protein shakes, or lightly flavored protein water were even worse. This is even after nausea medication and the motion sickness patches behind the ear. I started to run a low-grade fever and called my surgical team for advice. I was told to come to the ER so I could receive fluids and have a CT scan done to check for leaks. All of my lab work and the CT scan came back normal, but I was still readmitted to the bariatric unit for the night.

That next day in the hospital was the greatest one yet. I was able to get in 32 ounces of fluid on my own, plus 12g of protein. I was mobile, my spirits were great, and I felt like the worst was over. Granted, I still knew I had work to do with upping my fluid and protein intake, but it was the first time I was showing major improvement so I was feeling optimistic. I opted to go home from the hospital on the evening of day 4.

Today is day 5, and I started it off by getting in some sips of water and 4 ounces of the same protein shake I had the day before in the hospital. After that protein shake, I felt awful and began violently wretching again every 10-20 minutes for hours.

I feel so terrified that I am going to dehydrate or malnourish myself to death. It's been five days since surgery and I have only had maybe 100 calories / 24g of protein total. My team tells me just to focus on water, but I can't help but think that I'm going to die if I can't get enough nourishment. It seems like most people have a way better time of holding things down by day 5, and I'm still barely getting in 20 ounces of water.

TL/DR: I can't keep up with my liquid or protein intake and it's day 5 post-op. Everything causes me to violently gag and eventually spit up. 

Has this happened to anyone else? When did it get better for you? Any advice or words of encouragement are welcome. My spirits are pretty low today."
"Pre-op diet starts in 2 weeks. And the shakes are so, so awful.","Good news! I have a date! (June 27th). My pre-op diet starts on the 13th.

How long did you need protein shakes?,"I drink a premier protein every day. I'm 4 weeks out.

Question about starting Vitamins and going off Blood Pressure medication,"I have 2 questions.

I was told I wouldn't need to take my blood pressure medication anymore. Yesterday, just over a week after surgery, I felt a tension headache coming on, which I knew was an indicator for my blood pressure rising slightly.

Surgery day!!!!,
I keep reading about people havi g trouble getting water down right after surgery. Im 3 days post op VSG and easily getting 100oz a day. Is that bad?,Im worried that its too easy and maybe my surgery didnt work? I dunno. Probably paranoid.
My Bariatric 4th of July Meal,
Sleeved on June 12th. Constantly craving solid food.,"I had the sleeve done recently and am moving on to the purÃ©e stage this upcoming week. Iâ€™m so hungry all the time but iâ€™m honestly sick of protein shakes and broth. I constantly see my family having pizza and donuts and steak, and it kills me. Itâ€™s not their fault as this was my decision but i am struggling. Does anyone have some suggestions?"
At 280lbs hereâ€™s something I could have never done! Kayaking for the win! #NSV,
How did you find your doctor?,"Iâ€™m at the beginning of my journey. Had a consultation with a doctor I found on Yelp. He seemed competent, has been in the field for decades, explained the different procedures, benefits and risks, answered all my questions. Iâ€™m just wondering do people go to multiple doctors for consultations to determine who theyâ€™re going to go with for surgery?  How did you find your doctor? What weâ€™re deciding factors in choosing your doctor? "
VSG or Bypass? Unsure what to do!,"Hey everyone, first time post. 

Considering VSG but went to my consultation and felt bullied into getting the Bypass. Surgeon compared it to cancer saying I wouldn't choose a surgery with a lower success rate to get rid of my cancer so why am I even considering it for my weight loss? 

He continued his talk with the fervor of overt fear mongering. 

I felt VSG would be a good starting place since you can go from a VSG to a bypass but not vice versa. I'm 5'2"" and 225 lbs. I don't know what to do because half is saying give up all these things forever and the other half is saying give it up for a little bit, adhere to the diet 95% of the time and you can treat yourself. I don't have a binge eating problem or use food as a substitute for anything in life. 

I went in thinking a VSG would help me achieve my goals and get me where I want to be. But I feel stupid now for not choosing the other and making sure that I have the best chance as success given the studies found for weight loss patients. 

Any advice on how to choose? What you gave up? What did you get and your experience? "
BMI for surgery,"I'm on a wait list here in Canada for wls. I believe most of standards are the same in terms of requirements. I'm still working on my own to lose weight. Is there a BMI too low for them to operate? I'm strongly considering the sleeve HW:310 CW:248 5'0"" I believe my BMI is 48%."
what did you eat for breakfast?,"I had 1 egg scrambled. One slice of fresh mozzarella, one sausage link and some tomatoes with salsa over all of it."
"No ""Liquid Diet""???","Hi all, I'm new here!

I'm about a month away from getting an RNY (June) and just left my pre-op diet class. 

I've done a lot of research in the past year about WLS and I haven't heard of a pre-op diet like the one my doctor just put me on. 

They have me drinking 4 meal replacement drinks a day, and having one full food meal a day... for a month.

Is this normal? Has anyone else had a similar pre-op diet?"

7 month update from sleeve!,"* EDIT. Thanks for the gold and all the support you kind people ï¿½ï¿½*



Hey guys, thought Iâ€™d post a late 6 month update, itâ€™s actually been nearer 7 months now, but I hit a mile stone recently and wanted to share! Iâ€™ve lost 100lb! (45.6kg)

Op: Sleeve - 23/8/2018
Start Weight: 138kg / 304lb
Height: 170cm 
Starting BMI: 48 

NOW:

Weight: 92.4kg / 203.7lb
BMI: 32 (still obese but so close to that â€œoverweightâ€ range I can taste it)

Tips: Eat. Slow. 

I try to intermittent fast most days and just track all my calories on MyFitnessPal, and try to avoid unhealthy or unnecessarily filling foods like rice and pasta. Iâ€™m not getting enough protein in yet but Iâ€™m working on in and only in the last few months can I drink enough water per day. Itâ€™s hard so donâ€™t beat yourself up about it! 
I also excise 2-4 times per week for at least an hour at a time either in the gym or at a pole fitness class. 

I have my first flight since the op in a few weeks and Iâ€™m very excited to be sitting comfy in the chair for once.

Hereâ€™s a before and after pic if youâ€™re interested ^^ "
FINALLY! FOOD!,"I am finally moving to pureees and soft solids and had my first post-liquid meal. I pressure cooked some chicken breast, and added some salsa, a bit of cheese and a baby spoon (literally) of low fat sour cream and threw it in my ninja. After a month of eating air and drinking broth, it was the most incredible thing I've ever tasted!"
Did you have anyone stay the night in the hospital when you had your surgery?,"Hey guys, 

Wondering how was your experience the night after surgery. Did you have anyone, family or friend, stay with you in the hospital? 

If you had someone with you, did you need them or would have been ok to stay alone during the night? 

If you didnâ€™t have anyone, do you wish you had? 

Iâ€™m not sure if I should ask my partner to stay the night or not. 

Iâ€™m having surgery next week 6/27 btw. Any date buddies?"
5 months post op today! Down 50lbs since surgery and 80lbs from HW. Also lost 24 inches total! ï¿½ï¿½,

Post-op update: I am fine but it sucks a little.  I know pain and confusion will be over soon. Thank you for your kind messages â¤ï¸"
Goal Obliterated - Humblebrag,"I walked into my surgeon's office on my 40th birthday weighing 332 lbs.  He estimated that I would lose 100 lbs.  So my goal was 230 lbs.  I followed his pre-op program for the 6 months leading up to the surgery.  The executive summary of his program is to eat 1 lbs of green vegetables per day minimum with no upper limit.  Avoid carbs as best you can.  Eat a handful of nuts before you start snacking and set a 5 minute timer, then snack if you feel like it.  I also started walking.  At first it was just 20 minutes a day, but I eventually worked up to 2 hours a day.

I lost 50 lbs on the pre-op diet.  He changed his estimate on my final weight to 200 lbs.  That became my new goal.

After the surgery, I couldn't eat vegetables for a while.  Once I was able to finally eat vegetables again, I continued the pre-op diet.  Eating at least a pound of vegetables a day, avoiding carbs, eat some nuts and wait before snacking.  Why not?  It worked great and I never felt deprived of food.  At my 6 month post-op check in I was at 220.  He kept is estimate at 200, but I had revised my goal down to 180.

I made it to 200 and then plateaued for a while.  Then I discovered Intermittent Fasting.  IF synergizes very well with the surgery.  The hunger hormone called ""ghrelin"" is produced in the part of the stomach that is removed in both RnY and Sleeve.  So it's easier to resist the urge to eat.  After a fast the surgery feels tighter too so the urge to overeat after fasting is reduced.

After I started IF the scale started moving again.  It was moving almost as fast as the early days of the surgery.  I blew past 180 without even slowing down.  The surgeon was very pessimistic that I would keep it off.  He said I would gain it back.  I hit my all time low of 146 lbs in May of this year.  I've been bouncing 1 or 2 pounds above and below 150 since then.

It feels really good to have been so successful and to have proven the surgeon wrong.  I think I'm out of the danger zone for bouncing back up, but I keep an eye on it.  I have stopped following my routine for the last month.  I'm not eating my vegetables.  I'm not walking.  I'm not fasting.  So far the needle hasn't moved up or down.  I'm quite satisfied where I am.  If my weight starts to go up, I'll get back to work.

I just wanted to share and hopefully encourage anyone who feels like they are stuck."
I just got screwed.,"And not in the good way. I got this e-mail this morning:

""
Hello to everyone receiving this message.Â 

For those of you who don't know me, I'm Dr. [Name] the clinical psychologist at the [local hospital] bariatric program.Â 

I'm writing to everyone I can reach in an attempt to briefly respond to the multitude of emails and Facebook messages and group responses the [local hospital] Bariatric team has been receiving over the last 24 hours.Â 

To answer the biggest question: As of 3/29/19,Â  the [local hospital] bariatric program is closed. No further surgeries will be done and no new patients will be accepted in the program. For those who had surgeries scheduled next week, you should have already received a call informing you that your surgery was cancelled.Â 

The bariatric team will do our best to work with everyone over the next three months to help you cope with this news, the implications of no longer having the [local hospital] bariatric program, and how to progress forward. We as a team are going to do our best to help everyone adjust to this news and help plan for your futures. We are as affected by this news as I'm sure many of you are, and we understand how difficult this is for many of you.

If you have appointments with the dietician or psychology team next week, those appointments are still ""on."" However, those appointments will no longer ""count"" towards your qualification for any type of [local hospital] bariatric surgery. These appointments can be used to focus on health and wellness and to continue addressing mental health or dietary concerns.Â 

Next Monday at 5:00 pm, I will be hosting a bariatric group support meeting for anyone who would like to talk about their responses to the program closing and to ask any questions I am able to answer. This meeting will be held in the [...] the main meeting room, where the bariatric support group is usually held. This willÂ notÂ be the only support group we'll be having. However, I wanted to move as quickly as possible to provide a source of support and group conversation for everyone after the initial news broke.Â 

For those of you unable to make the meeting, please schedule an appointment with me so we can address your individual concerns individually. If you have questions you would like to email me, please send me an email atÂ 

[Email]

I'm asking those of you who are on the bariatric support groups or Facebook pages who have access to our other patients to please share this message with others. We understand how incredibly difficult this time is for many of you, and we're going to do our best to help.Â 

Best Regards,Â 
[Name]

And my response:

""
[Name],

Your e-mail is the first I've heard of the program closure. If this were April 1st I'd call it a sick joke. I had a pre-op endoscopy with Dr. [Surgeon] literally YESTERDAY... and now I'm being told that the whole program has vanished overnight. What. The. Hell.

I'll be at the meeting on Monday, but I'm so confused and upset right now. I'm sobbing my eyes out and wondering how the rug could be pulled out from under me, and many others, just like that. Even those who already had surgeries scheduled? I was scheduled for **April 16th**. I've been through so much struggle, and I've done everything that was asked of me. I've been coached and encouraged and commended on my success in this program, only to have the goal post whisked away to god knows where.

I don't even have another option. I have [local hospital] insurance through my work. and it's valid only in the [local hospital] network. I have ZERO coverage anywhere else. Any referral I get from the team is useless. Of course I'm not angry with you or any of the office team, but who DO I get angry at? What am I supposed to do now?

I mostly want to know why. I can't find any news information about how this came about. Please help me understand what happened.

Thank you,
[Me]
""

And the reply to that:

""
I know [me]. I can't even begin to understand how you're feeling about this. If you're at the meeting Monday maybe I can help answer some of those questions or others will have suggestions. I know you did nothing wrong. Nobody did anything wrong. This was just a decision that was made and it's out of everyone's control. So we're going to do our best to figure out how to help from here as a team.
""

If you really care about which hospital this is, you can figure it out from my post history. 

Any advice is appreciated.

"Don't EVER let someone make you feel like surgery is the ""easy way"".","For me the easiest part of this journey was the decision to do it. Bariatric surgery involves a complete lifestyle change and way of thinking about food and eating. Many people don't understand what we go through and deal with on a daily basis. I, like many of you, have spent a lifetime trying to do this on my own only to fail repeatedly. No, this isn't easy but it is necessary. "
Frustrated with myself and insurance requirements,"Hi all-

&amp;#x200B;

I found out I was denied coverage by my insurance. The official letter says that I don't need the surgery- their reasoning is because I gained weight during the 6 month diet/nutrition phase. I do own up to it my weight did increase. I'm irritated that I don't get credit for trying. I was steady for 2 months, then lost 7 lbs, then my weight went back to my starting weight and then I gained 7 pounds...and then another 3 in the last month. Keeping a steady weight has never been a reality for me. I'm either gaining  because I give into the hunger or losing because I'm exercising 14 hours a week (I'm working on my dissertation right now and don't have that kind of time). Unfortunately for me, I'm too close to the 40 BMI without significant co-morbidties. The insurance also doesn't count my sleep apnea because it only happens in REM and when I'm on my back (I think they called it ""positional apnea"". It's like I was expected to stay in place and stop breathing for 6 months. Don't lose, don't gain...oh and the co-morbidity that we found isn't co-morbid enough, thanks for playing ""navigate our privatized healthcare system!!""    


If I could do this alone, I wouldn't be seeking help. When I got this news today, I didn't even turn to food as a coping mechanism! I rode my bike (15 miles), I walked my dog (2 miles), and I liquid fasted today to jumpstart the weight loss...and tomorrow I'll go back to IF 16:8. Why couldn't I get points for that? The nutritional guidance and therapy I'm getting has helped but the insurance company can't see that.   


I'm feeling fragile and angry. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I spoke to the surgeon's assistant, she said I can continue my monthly weigh-ins and when I return to my starting weight, she'll resubmit my claim. I made my PCP appointment for April 1  


I really just needed to rant. Does anyone from the US have an interesting path to surgery? I'd just like to know that I'm not the only one who has screwed up their 6 month diet and insurance approval. What did you do to get back on your feet? How long did it take you to get surgery? "
Chewable women's multi-vitamin?,"Hi all, 

I had surgery Monday so I switched over from gummy vitamins to a generic equivalent to a 1-A-Day Women's. I think those vitamins are making me nauseous and have caused me to vomit. My bariatirc clinic suggested chewable vitamins, but I can't seem to find those. There are 25 different gummy kind, but I didn't see a single chewable. Any recommendations? "
"4.5 months difference, so grateful!",
I'd get this done quicker if I could do the surgery on myself. Rant,"My initial appt was in Feb. 2018, it's been well over a year and just today my team tells me it'll probably be around Jan 2020 before I'm scheduled. My initial appt was quoted at 3-6 months ï¿½ï¿½

I've passed all physical checks
Psych has signed off 
Never missed an appt

There's literally nothing holding me back except the dietician. I've also met everything on her list of requirements BUT she's the only 1 I pay out of pocket for. She will not sign off. I don't get it. My surgeon is the other issue, she's on board with getting this done but now she's pregnant and will be off from Sept / Jan. 

You guys, I'm frustrated and I just kind of feel like this will never happen for me. If I put as much effort into idk.. weight watchers for example I'd probably have lost 50 pounds by now. 

In fact, I've been told through this entire process to hault all weight loss efforts as I don't have any medical conditions due to weight and my bmi is right on the edge, if it falls a few numbers, I won't qualify. 

Would you keep on keepin' on for another 8 months or just forget it and go another route? I have 70lbs to lose and I just can't keep doing nothing about it. 

Thanks in advance for any thoughts / opinions."
Anyone had a tubal ligation at the same time as WLS?,"So I struggled with infertility for YEARS (still never been pregnant except for one ectopic) and my periods were crappy so I got an ablation earlier this year. However, as most of you probably know, when there's no clear reason for infertility, it often gets resolved with major weight loss. (my embryos were perfect, uterus just didn't want to be pregnant) so I know that there's a decent chance I could conceive after losing weight. With an ablation its extremely advised against to get pregnant - it's not really safe and leads to miscarriage, ectopic, early delivery, among other issues in most cases.

So since I can't ever have a kid naturally (and we adopted and are done anyways), I asked my WLS peeps if they could do a tubal ligation at the same time to avoid having to be on birth control for a long time (I'm still fairly young) and they said they can work with my gyno to do that if I'd like to. It would be easier to have it done at the same time since I'll already be under anesthesia. 

Anyone else have experience doing this?"
Response from Premier Protein,
Feel like odd one out at weight loss support group,"Hello all! So I am reaching out in hopes of advice/sharing of your own experience pertaining to weight loss support groups. My group is pre-op and post-op, each sharing and asking questions. I went this Thursday and honestly it really bummed me out. Everyone there was at least 15 years older than me, which in itself is not a problem at all, but it seemed to be an underlying factor in our disconnect. I asked about three questions:

* When were you able to begin more intensive exercising after surgery and what steps did you take (i.e. from walking to running or lifting)
* Do you have certain recommendations for lower carb protein powder and blenders? 
* What did you find the most successful way of managing all your new vitamin medications?

For the first question, they looked at me like I was crazy and not ONE of them had asked their doctor more intensive exercise than walking. One said that it would be too dangerous because of my incisions, and I reiterated that I was asking on when they were CLEARED. The second question most of them just talked about getting protein any way you can and to just grind up my chicken because its cheaper. Then they went on a tangent about their favorite ground up food. And, lastly, I actually got a few decent responses on vitamins but it ended with a very unhappy woman yelling ""If you don't take your vitamins, you will DIE."" 

From that last comment, another pre-op patient accused this woman of trying to scare us because her surgery was ineffective last year, and the facilitator allowed a yelling match for five minutes straight!! There were other questions I asked but they were usually not answered or only partially answered before someone wanted to talk more about themselves and what they think of surgery. 

I guess I am just really disappointed. I am five pounds away from my weight goal for surgery, and this group just was the opposite of supportive for me. Having my questions go unanswered, redirected, or talked over. I hated having to listen to things for 10 minutes at a time because people just want to talk about trash bags, or the storage under their bed, or how their sun is graduating. It felt like really poorly run group therapy with a splash of weight loss. I felt that the environment was hostile with some members coming back to just talk trash about surgery or warn of the negatives. 

I want to have a group of people I feel supported by, but I am not sure what to think now. There were some really nice people in the session that helped me a bit, but they, like me, were exhausted by everyone else and eventually checked from the 2 hour session. Has anyone else had an experience like this? How have others felt about their support groups?"
Any books you recommend?,"Hello all! While I wait for my appointment with the surgeon/dietitian/psychotherapist/insurance coordinator next month, Iâ€™m trying to do all I can to learn as much as possible about bariatric surgery. Iâ€™ve found some good online resources, but am looking for a good book. When I was pregnant I read â€œwhat to expect when youâ€™re expectingâ€ and I wish there was a â€œwhat to expect when youâ€™re having your organs surgically alteredâ€ something in depth and goes beyond explaining the differences between the surgeries. If you know of a good one, Iâ€™d love to read it. Likewise, if thereâ€™s a particularly good online resource, Iâ€™d love to check it out too. "
Traveling post-op,"TL;DR: How far out from surgery were you okay to travel (long distance car ride/plane)? I might be at the end of stage 4 soft foods by the time I'm hoping to attend a wedding, am I going to be ok?

Hi everybody. My primary care doctor recommended this path to me back in January. I met with my surgeon and he likes the sleeve for me. I have one appointment left and then I'll have all of my clearances, and my team will submit to insurance.

When I started this process, I had asked my surgeon about driving across several states (approx 18 hour trip) for a wedding in the family in November. He said it should be fine, and he was estimating my surgery to be some time in September based on the requirements of my insurance. Honestly, I've been dead set on going to this wedding. It's really important to me. I've made all of my appointments with the hope that I'll be ""post-op enough"" to travel in time, and everyone has encouraged me that I'll be fine. This surgery is also really important to me, and I don't think pushing it back a couple of months to attend the wedding is really an option.  I'm doing this for my health, which should not be put on hold, and I might talk myself out of it with that much time to wait.

I spoke with my team member who deals with insurance. She said insurance usually approves within 2-3 weeks and they're scheduling about 6 weeks out. My insurance has given pre-auth for everything else I've needed within 2-3 business days.

Absolute best case scenario, let's say it takes a week for submission, to get pre-auth, and get scheduled. Stage 4 post-op diet is soft foods and my team says I'll be on that for 2-3 weeks. It would bring me to just 2 days before the wedding. We'd either be in the car on that day or it would be the day before we have to hop on a plane ($$$ which is why we were planning to drive). I'm still not sure which way of travel would be less terrible.

My question to you post-op'ers.. is this even feasible? Am I going to be risking my health to stay on top of liquids, trying to find acceptable sources of food while traveling? I know in general I'm a slow healer but I'm also determined as hell. I'm also aware that post-op diet can be challenging, and my stomach will be adjusting to every new food I give it. This may not be a mind over matter kind of thing.. but I need to hear from you guys before I can decide that there's no way I'm making it to this wedding. What do you think?"
Flintstones Multivitamins: Tasty and Inadequate for Bariatric Surgery Patients,
HMO (Kaiser) Keeps Prolonging the Process,"Hi all! So I started the process of trying to get wls (in my case, sleeved) back at the end of November. My HMO, Kaiser, at first made the process seem very straight forward. Here's how they described it:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Upon approval, you take a class.
2. After the class, you pass a test proving you paid attention and that you read the guidebook they gave you.
3. You meet with the surgeon who sets your target weight, which you must meet in order to get the surgery.
4. Once you meet the target weight, you message the surgeon and the nurse practitioner to get a surgery date and a mental health screening. Here's the key part: I was told very specifically that the time it should take from when I met the target weight to when I would actually be on the table would be 1-2 weeks. That it wouldn't be a problem getting scheduled ASAP.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem first started when I took the test that you're required to pass. They asked questions that were absolutely not covered in the guidebook or in the class. Furthermore, some of the information they gave us flat out contradicted itself. I pointed this out to the dietician, who is responsible for grading the test, and he understood my concerns and agreed with me that there were some problems but that seemed to have put me on the naughty list.

&amp;#x200B;

Next thing I know, they want me to get screened for sleep apnea- which costed a fortune and was completely unnecessary as I don't have sleep apnea and didn't even have symptoms of it. Then the nurse practitioner tells me I have to switch methods of birth control- so I make the switch and then the surgeon messages me saying he doesn't like what I switched to so I have to switch to something else. Always with a veiled threat- if I don't do what they want then I don't get the surgery.

&amp;#x200B;

So I follow their meal plan and met (actually surpassed) the target weight by a few pounds. I message the surgeon and the nurse practitioner. Surgeon responds right away that he's fully booked until March 21st but one of his fellow surgeons might be available on March 6th. This completely contradicts what I had been previously told- I was counting on having the surgery no later than February 15th. I ask how I should go about trying to get the earlier date. he responds to me about an hour ago saying I have to pass the psych screening first before getting a surgery date. That again, is completely contradictory. The psych appointment isn't until next Thursday, and I  worry that by then I'm not going to get a surgery date before the end of April.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a massive problem. I am planning on moving to a different state sometime in June or July. Actually, I wanted to move sooner, but decided to wait until I had the surgery. They keep prolonging the process and giving me more hoops to jump over. I'm worried that if this continues, I won't be able to move until far later than I wanted to and that's going to impact my career and personal life.

&amp;#x200B;

Brief Update: They just called to reschedule my psych screening. I now won't be able to be seen by the psychologist so I can even get the surgery date until February 12th. That was the earliest they had. I feel like I'm being completely jerked around :("
had surgery Monday...pain is killing me,Is this normal? I feel like Goldilocks trying to find the best place to sit/sleep/be.

"My Telogen Effluvium (hair loss, with pics)","Hey guys, Iâ€™m a little nervous posting this. But I figured it could help people who have or will be having surgery. 

https://imgur.com/a/yuws33Y

(Iâ€™m sorry if you find the shower wall picture gross! But thatâ€™s how much hair I loose in one shampoo/condition. Plus more when I brush... or run my fingers through my hair...)

Obviously, this is about hair loss, specifically Telogen Effluvium. I was officially diagnosed by my dermatologist with TE and am just trying to get through and have some hope for the next few months. 

I had surgery 5 months ago, Iâ€™m 5â€™5, start weight was 233, current weight is 167. I had the sleeve.

I have quite a bit of diffuse loss and it has no sign of slowing down. I take vitamins and biotin. In my opinion, biotin canâ€™t help this. Itâ€™s just something that canâ€™t be stopped if youâ€™re going to get it. 

And just so everyone knows, NOT EVERYONE WILL GET THIS. And if you do, it may be a much milder form. God forbid any worse! 

If I had the balls or facial structure I would shave my head. Alas, I have neither lol. 

I included the last two pics to show that *it is worth it.* I have about 20 pounds left until goal.

5 months out,"My TL:dr advice: do the emotional work, keep your food simple, track everything, move daily

Tomorrow will be 5 months since my surgery but I won't be able to weigh myself again til Thursday so here's my update a day early.

I'm down a total of 85 pounds (22 pre op, 63 post). I started at a size 20 and now I'm into 12s (with an occasional 14 or 10, depending on cut/brand). I had my surgery in MX and would do it again. I've had zero complications. My weight loss has been on the slow side (but not *slow*) and steady, with a few stalls along the way. Once you accept stalls as *part of* this process it's much easier to ride them out.  

It's been incredibly easy to do this and I keep it *very* simple. I track everything I put in my mouth. I take my supplements religiously. I walk daily and I take pilates and barre classes. I've been yo-yo dieting for years, so I already have some (not excessive) jiggle, but I haven't noticed any *more* loose skin and I don't anticipate needing (or wanting) cosmetic surgery. I haven't lost *any* hair.

I have done a lot of therapy over the years to understand my relationship with food/my body, so the mental/emotional part of this has been very manageable. If you're considering this, do that work - I can't imagine trying to deal with all the changes not having done it.  

My daily diet looks like this: I don't eat until 12-1pm and I stop eating at 6pm. I focus on protein. I eat things like cottage cheese, deli turkey, hard boiled or deviled eggs, yogurt, meatballs, shredded chicken or beef, fish, tuna, shrimp, protein shakes that I boost with flavorless protein powder, and then, if I have any room, I'll do some veggies - spinach, mostly. My portions are 2.5-3ozs, or 3/4cup of something. I weigh and measure EVERYTHING. If you're someone who says ""There's no way I can be eating more than xxx calories,"" start weighing and measuring and you'll be shocked at how wrong you are. I rarely eat more than 650 calories/day, often closer to 500-550. I feel great - never weak or low energy, and no hunger. I have to make a concerted effort to get in my 64ozs of water - that's the hardest part, and it's often because I just feel full all day.

I haven't had sugar, bread, crackers, rice, pasta, or any kind of snacky/dessert foods. That includes fake versions of those things. Slippery slope. To me, this isn't about finding ways to have those things and get away with it. I don't miss any of it because my weight loss feels so much better to me than the momentary satisfaction from those would feel. That said, if I went to a wedding, I'd have a couple bites of cake. If I'm going to do it, I'd do the real thing and then be done with it.

I still want to lose another 60-80 pounds. I have no idea what I'll look like when I get there, so that's why I'm keeping the range open. If the ""honeymoon stage"" is real I think I will get there by my 1 year surgery anniversary (total weight loss 145-165lbs). I feel so good. I'm so much more mobile and it's so much easier to get around - I didn't even realize how hard it had been until I now see how easy it is. I can pop up out of any chair and hop on over to anywhere. I take the stairs 2 at a time. Pre op I spent a lot of time at home on the couch and doing the smallest thing took so much effort. Now I am up and out and doing things and the thought doesn't cross my mind that I wouldn't be able to do anything I want to do.

My only regret is that I didn't do this 20 years ago."
I'm only losing about 2 and a half pounds a week. Is that normal?,"I'm 10 weeks post op vsg. I've only been losing 2.5 pounds per week since surgery. Starting weight of 605, Surgery weight was 381, current weight around 355(depending on the time of day I weigh myself).

It seems pretty slow, especially given my age, sex, and high starting weight. Is this normal? Should I be worried?"
This was a fun picture to take,
"I'm 2 weeks post-op sleeve and am just starting the pureed/fork mashed soft food stage. Does anybody know if it's safe to eat a chopped salad as long as I make sure that the salad is chopped very finely? I'm spending the 4th somewhere that makes AWESOME chopped salads, so I'm just wondering.",
VSG 0103 my thoughts so far.,"Am I allowed to regret this?  The first day of surgery my pain was more in my upper stomach. A constant pain that never went away but wasn't unbearable. 

Yesterday I had the worst 35 minutes of my life. The surgeon came in to take a look at the drain. He cleared me to go home. Then a sharp stabbing pain happened. Every time I breathed it felt like I was being stabbed with a knife. I cried,  I moaned,  probably freaked out the other patients. 

The nurse was discharging another patient so didn't come see me for 30 minutes. Then she said the drain must have moved. Pulled it out (not the worst). She gave me an extra push of pain medicine. Of course that caused me to vomit. 

Today is better. But looking back on this... I would not put myself through this again.

Restricted foods....forever?,"Disclaimer: NONE of this applies to the weeks *immediately* pre and post op. I'm curious about 6 months, 1 year, 10 years post op.

I've been a chronic dieter for decades. 80-100 pound weight swings several times in the last 10 years alone. **I firmly believe that it's dieting that has brought me here.** I probably weigh 300 pounds.

I've been on every diet imaginable (HcG, WW, Keto, SB, Jenny Craig, Fat Flush, NutriSystem....you name it). 

I've read nearly every post on this sub, and a couple of times I've read things like ""you'll never eat steak/rice/bread again."" That worries me. Not because I want to go hog wild on any of those things, but because the thought of *still* not being able to eat like a normal person (a wide variety of whole, nutritious foods from every food group) scares me. I have *always* rebelled when I've been on a diet that is ultra restrictive. 

What is your experience? 



"
Protein tips?,"I'm nearly two months post-op right now and I'm having a heck of a time getting protein in. Hell, food at all. Seems like most everything upsets my stomach. Not to the point of being ill but more like 'uggh don't feel so hot'. Red meat does not settle at ALL. I hate fish. Pork doesn't settle well. Chicken is not bad but I can only eat a few bites. 

And that's another issue I'm running into. I still can only get in about 3 or 4 bites of any meat before I'm full. Which makes it difficult to get any protein in. I can usually eat a bit over a cup of salad without a problem. And soups about 3/4 cup. But meat just kills me. Any suggestions for getting in more protein that's not going back to those shakes? Lol I'm so tired of them."
I made it!!,"After months of hard work I finally made it to the other side. My surgery was yesterday afternoon and everything went as well as it could possibly go. The loopiness from the anesthesia has worn off and my pain is under control. Iâ€™ve been walking around really well, too. Canâ€™t wait to see what this new journey has in store! "
I am a week away from RNY!,"eeeeeeeeeeee I am a week away, and still have to get my bag packed and head to the piercing shop later to get my nose ring taken out (for some reason I cannot get it myself).

&amp;#x200B;

I AM SO EXCITED AND JUST WANTED TO SHARE WITH ALL OF YOU GUYS. mainly because I can't contain it, lol.

So excited. And also, a huge thanks to all of you guys in the subreddit. The advice and support for me and the rest of the community is awesome and has made me feel so much better.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope everyone is having a good week.

Edit: I didn't have to remove my nose ring after all. I called them and apparently a ton of people either forget or they physically cannot get it out. Since the piercing place was booked (appointment only) I called to ask. I just had to sign a waiver and they put tape over it. But yay!!!!! I had surgery! "
Affordable Vitamin Options,"My doctor has recommended I take a multivitamin, B1,  and Calcium Citrate. He has specifically encouraged Bariatric Advantage and Fusion brands. These brands are expensive.   


Have you found a less expensive option that meets your needs?"
I don't know if I can do this. Part Deux.,"So y'all helped calm my fears a lot with the last post that I made, so I wanted to reach out again because shit is getting real.  My nutritionist just approved me and my surgery could be as soon as next month.  Yikes.

My constant worry now is the thought of throwing up.  I have emetophobia and haven't thrown up in over 13 years (::knocks on wood::) and don't plan on breaking my record any time soon.  Is there anyone out there like me?  Is there anyone who hasn't gotten sick?  I always imagined my emetophobia working in my favor once I've healed because I'm going to be super, super, super careful and frightful of everything that I put in my mouth.  

I'm scared shitless. Help me. Again."
At what age did you start struggling with your weight?,"I remember being called â€˜fattyâ€™ at school age 9, and always being the bigger one. My weight went up and down through to end of high school when I got mono and was very sick for 18 months and packed on a bunch of weight. I was bordering on obese at that point. But it wasnâ€™t until I was around 24 and my BMI went from 30 to probably about 45 where it has stayed for the last 12 years and now it is 52 and Iâ€™m 3 weeks away from gastric sleeve surgery!

What about you? "
Psychiatric eval w/ mental illness history,"I had my first appointment with the bariatric surgeon. She wasnâ€™t very emotional (or maybe my jokes suck), but was very thorough a smart. She wants to do a modified duodenal switch and signed me up for three sessions with the nutritionist.

I came home with a lot of info and begin the packet for the psych eval coming up in May. I got kinda nervous because I am bipolar and in the past I was hospitalized for suicide attempts twice.

Soooo, what are the chances of being denied because of this? Iâ€™m very stable now and see a psychiatrist and take meds. I want to sign up for therapy as well.  Iâ€™m doing all the right things, but Iâ€™m still nervous."

For those here that get their period: when you started exercising (for really the first time ever) did your body/menstrual cycle freak out?,"When I say I was sedentary before, itâ€™s an understatement. You couldnâ€™t get me to walk around the block. I am finally moving. I started walking every other day 3-5 miles beginning on June 8th. 

My last cycle started 4 days earlier than expected.  No big. I put it on the fact that I started exercising for the first time since middle school. Well now itâ€™s 15 days later and I FREAKING STARTED AGAIN. Is this normal for someone who starts exercise who has never consistently done so... like ever?

I would really appreciate any insight you might have. I will bring it up with my doctor at my next appointment but I donâ€™t want to be concerned until then. 

Thank you in advance for any help you can offer!"
"Down 133 pounds, have about 30 to go! Almost a year into this journey",
"High protein, no dairy??","Any suggestions?

I'm 4 months out. I rely a lot on cottage cheese and yogurt because they're easy to grab and go, I love both, and they're good sources of protein. Dairy, however, makes my eczema flare. I also have a slight sensitivity to eggs. 

What are some easy things to grab that aren't dairy and aren't smelly (meals at work)? Tuna and chicken salad are both mixed with mayo (dairy) so those aren't options either. 

Black beans, quinoa, etc., are good protein sources but then my carbs get to high."

Setting weight loss goals?,"How does everyone set a weight loss goal, if they do at all? Iâ€™m 160 cam tall. The print out from my dietician says 63 kilos should be my goal, but she has brushes that off and said the right weight is whatever feels right to me at the time and she believes more in goals about fitness and wellness rather than numbers. My weight tracking app says 53 kilos which seems ridiculously tiny to me!

Iâ€™ve decided to set a weight goal of 62 kilos mainly because itâ€™s exactly half of my highest ever weight and it seems achievable (Iâ€™m currently 84 kilos). Iâ€™m starting to achieve my fitness goals and have my first horse riding class this weekend. Once I can ride and am light enough I can use my sons pony, as I would have to be 65 kilos or less due to her size.

Regretting surgery...RNY 2/6/19,"Hi! Has anyone else regretted having surgery? I think it was the worst decision I have made in my life. Does it get better?

1. Had RNY 2/6...lost 32 lbs in three weeks, but  nothing in the past week. (Eating 60-70 grams of clean protein and 600-700 calories a day)

2. Not sleeping. Dealing with complete exhaustion. Sleep meds I was on pre surgery aren't helping....(do they get absorbed differently?)

3. Now I have an ULCER. Can't eat without vomiting. Started meds for this yesterday. Now I still can't eat, because I need 3 hours of not eating around each dose of medication, which I have to take four times a day for four weeks. (No eating an hour before taking or two hours after.)

Talking to nurse most days..... Doctor knows what is going on.

Please tell me it gets better 

Thank you!"
What's life like a year or more out?,"I just had a surgical consultation and I've been reviewing some literature provided. There are a lot of rules that I'm unclear if it applies to the healing time or rest of your life. Some examples. No liquids with meals, no carbonated beverages, no alcohol, no caffeine, chewing 20+ times each bite, etc. None of these things are deal breakers, just trying to piece together what life will most likely be and get mentally prepared. 

Thank you all."
Done yesterday rny,So yesterday was the day. I got to the hospital and was fast tracked because the person before me was a no show. So in stead of 10 I was bped up to 8 am. I was in the or by 815. The pain yesterday was fierce. Thank goodness for morphine. Even then I was still in pain. Last night was crazy long. Hardly able to pee. Only 25 ml or so at a time all night. I'm now getting my last iv morphine before switching to oral. Bit nervous to try orally yet but it must be done at some point. Over all a bit more pain then I was expecting but not too bad all things considered. 
When to tell extended family about intentions,"When did you all tell your extended family/friends network about your WLS intentions? 

Iâ€™m at the very beginning of my journeyâ€”havenâ€™t seen the bariatric doctor even. Iâ€™m currently waiting on my psychiatrist to clear me to even consider surgery, but my PCP made the referral and Iâ€™m in touch with the patient advocate at my WL clinic. 


My husband says I should tell my mom because he thinks she will need to come and help when I recuperate. I donâ€™t think she will need to come. I had my gallbladder out 5 years ago (laparoscopically) and we managed. Plus our daughter was 4/5 years old then! Sheâ€™s almost 11 nowâ€”definitely 11 by the time I have WLS. Am I the asshole? LOL

Iâ€™d prefer to only mention it once Iâ€™m at the scheduling phase. I donâ€™t want to hear the negativity  from the peanut gallery. 

I am 37 and we want to have one more baby. Iâ€™m morbidly obese. Iâ€™m sure everyone is going to tell me not to do either! I just need to get healthier and I think this is a good start. Also, Iâ€™m not fertile currently and my obgyn thinks itâ€™s the obesity. She said that Iâ€™d likely have to wait 18-24 months post-surgery, but itâ€™s healthier to be at a lower weight and older than to do it now. 

Thanks for listening...




Thoughts?"
My sleeve surgery is tomorrow.,"27 M  SW:365 CW:355 GW:??

After about a 6 month process with my surgeon/my new surgeon (the first one fell ill) my surgery appointment is tomorrow at 9:45.   It's my first surgery and my first time under anesthesia. I'm pretty nervous but very happy to be doing this.   

Any advice for the day of/hospital stay?"
"Huge insurance issue, has this happened to anyone else?","I have United Healthcare. They cover the surgery at 80%, however my husband's employer, who we have insurance through, pays the surgery 100%. We followed all their rules and it was preapproved, etc.  

Well, United Healthcare has somehow come to the conclusion that they would cover everything but anesthesia. They magically decided that the anesthesiologist was out of network and they arent paying the doctor. And we just got a bill for $3000, according to my EOB we have another $6000 bill on the way.   

Here are the facts:   

- You can't have surgery without anesthesia.    

- I didnt have any say over my anesthesiologist and didnt even meet him until the day of surgery.   

- He is employed by an in network hospital which was on my preapproval.  

- Even if he was truly out of network, I have out of network coverage, they just pay less. This claim was entirely outright rejected.   


What concerns me is that with all the obvious facts above, it still somehow got past insurance, past my husband's employer and past the anesthesiologist billing office and a bill was sent to me. I feel like I'm at their mercy and if insurance is like, ""lol nah, we don't feel like paying this"" is there really anything I can do about it? Where do I even start?"

- is it like being on a diet for the rest of your life
- is it way too easy to regain weight?
- do you feel like youâ€™ve got a craving but then canâ€™t have it because itâ€™ll make you sick? Or does the craving go away
- do you worry about being elderly with the surgery and being able to maintain enough nourishment? Are there people in their 80s with wls or do we not live that long?

Ultimate Guide to Pre and Post Op,"I have been looking around the sub and there's always a smattering of suggestions, but I thought we could all contribute to a larger guide. The organizer in me wants to put things into different boxes, so let me know if you have suggestions. I'm putting together what I've seen in other posts, so please add anything you think would be useful.

**Pre-Op**

*Questions to Ask the Doctor*

Hopefully, these will be answered without having to ask them, but have them in mind.

*1st Visit*

1. What are your policies for getting approved? How do you work with the insurance?
2. What type of surgery do you suggest for me? Why?
3. How quickly can I get approved?
4. What are the pros and cons to the different surgeries? Side effects? Risks?
5. How many days should I take off? What is the FMLA process? 
6. Are there any weight loss support groups?
7. How often do we meet before and after surgery?
8. Do I have any co-morbidities?

*Pre-Op Visit*

1. How can I deal with nausea? Diarrhea? Constipation? Pain? (Many doctors write a prescription for meds to cover these symptoms.)
2. How many days will I be at the hospital? In recovery? Unable to carry over 10 lbs of weight?
3. How soon can I start exercising? Walking? Biking? Elliptical? Weight-lifting?
4. What medications can I keep taking? What and when do I need to stop them?
5. How long will the surgery take?

*Questions to Ask Nutritionist*

1. What Vitamins should I use? Can you help me get a prescription for them? (Some insurance companies cover Nascobol).
2. Can you provide a list of recommended protein shakes/powders/waters?
3. What are my Macros for Protein/Carbs/Fat before and after surgery?
4. What am I allowed to eat/drink the first 1-3 weeks? 3-6 weeks? After? (Rough estimates are 64+oz water, 500-800 calories first six months, 700-900 6 months to a year and and 1000-1200 after 1 year depending on exercise.)
5. What is my pre-op diet? What do you recommend for tracking weight loss? When do I start the pre-op diet? (Week before surgery avoid blood thinners like NSAIDs, multivitamins, vitamin E, garlic. Also do not eat sugar and cut down to 40-50g (or what is recommended by your nutritionist) carbs per day for liver shrinking)
6. Do you have food recommendations for &lt;x&gt; allergies/intolerances?

*Things to Buy*

1. Broth (Most people have less of a taste for sweet after surgery)
2. High protein shakes/powders
3. 2-ounce mini cups to practice sipping from
4. Flavored water/Gatorade Zero/Powerade Zero or flavor packets
5. Heating pad. As suggested by u/rifrif, shouldn't be used on stomach. Use on back, shoulders, legs to relieve pain/stiffness.
6. Wedge pillow for side sleepers
7. Gas-X. Miralax. Anti-nausea meds. Tylenol (no ibuprofen for RNY).

*Things to Keep in Mind*

1. Try different foods way before surgery. Buy yourself a bariatric cookbook and test out the soup recipes. There's nothing worse than being bored with what you have and having no idea how to make things you can eat. 
2. This is a lifetime change. Try not to have 'food funerals' as you'll have a higher chance of relapsing into your old eating habits. 
3. Get samples of protein powders from GNC, etc. Some protein vendors have â€˜test packagesâ€™ available online for 10-15 dollars.
4. Start counting Macros sooner than later. Be aware of how much sugar/carbs are in everything youâ€™re eating. 
5. Many companies will approve short term disability (most have to follow FMLA), so reach out to your HR.
6. You do not have to tell anyone about the surgery, donâ€™t feel required to reveal what youâ€™re going through. However, it is good to have a friend/spouse/partner go with you to your appointments.
7. If you have consistent heartburn/acid reflux, VSG tends to make it worse while RNY makes it better. Some people with no acid reflux develop it after VSG.
8. Take a â€˜beforeâ€™ picture to commemorate how much you changed after surgery. Also take your starting measurements: Arms, legs, chest, neck, hips, waist. It will be a big motivator.
9. Some doctors can fix small hernias during surgery, but theyâ€™ll often put off fixing hernias until your weight is lower.
10. Psychological reviews are meant to see what mental state youâ€™re in. If youâ€™re actively suicidal, theyâ€™ll work to help you get through that before surgery. Be honest as they want to make you as successful as possible. Go into the meeting with a vague idea of what causes you to overeat. 
11. VSG (Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy) leaves a banana sized stomach and the rest is removed. It can hold about 4oz of food at a time. The weight loss over the first 2 years is 40-80% of your excess weight. 7 year outlook is approximately 50-60% of weight loss since it is easier to 'eat around' the sleeve.
12. Gastric Bypass or Roux-n-y (RNY) is your stomach portioned into three sections. You'll have a 'pouch' leftover that can hold about 2oz of food at a time. Your bowls will be 'bypassed' to enable malabsorption so your body processes fewer calories. The weight loss over the first two years is 60-80%. The 7 year outlook is approximately 60-70% weight loss maintained. 
13. DS (Duodenal Switch) is part VSG and part RNY. Your stomach is sleeved like in VSG, but your intestines are 'rerouted' even farther than RNY to enable maximum malabsorption. This surgery also has the highest risk of complications so many people tend to shy away from it. The weight loss over the first two years is 70-90% and the 7 year outlook is approximately 70-80% weight loss maintained. 

**Post-Op**

*Things to Keep in Mind*

1. Start walking as soon as possible. Preventing blood clots is extremely important. Walking also moves gas out of your system. Gas-X only works on gas in the GI system. They blow up your abdominal wall during surgery so youâ€™ll have excess gas outside the GI system.
2. Write out a schedule for drinking/eating. 
3. Food addictions have a habit of transferring to other things like alcohol and pain killers. It is best to avoid these in the future.
4. Carbonated drinks are not supposed to be consumed ever again after surgery as it causes massive bloat, but some people drink small amounts and are not bothered. Alcohol is not supposed to be consumed until 1 year after surgery. One beer/wine tends to make wls patients drunk.
5. Sugars (especially for RNY) should be avoided in the future. RNY patients often experience dumping syndrome.
6. Personality changes happen often after surgery. Hormones are stored in fat and are released during weight loss causing mood swings. This is temporary but can be severe.
7. Tastes change after surgery. Some people find that they severely dislike sweet protein shakes so make sure to have broths/strained soups available.
8. Donâ€™t buy new clothes if possible. You will lose weight quickly so try to keep clothes that will fit you for a while. 
9. Skin surgery is normally suggested 1 year after final weight has been reached. 
10. Vitamins need to be chewable for the first 8 weeks
11. A lot of people need gallbladder removal after weight loss. Quick weight loss causes the creation of gallstones. 
12. Many people experience temporary hair loss. This is due to the shock of the surgery/rapid weight loss. Take vitamins and keep up with protein. Some people add collagen powders to shakes to help with skin and hair. 
13. Itâ€™s recommended to find coping mechanisms for stress - massages, exercise, etc. Be consistent. 
14. Have â€˜rewardsâ€™ listed out for when you hit a certain goal. They absolutely cannot be food-related. Things like trips, new clothes, games, books to celebrate.
15. Do not pick up heavy objects for at least 1-2 months. Hernias are very easy to develop while incisions are healing.
16. Consider using Silicone tape on your scars to keep them from being raised.
17. Nearly everyone ends up stalling a few weeks after surgery as well as 4-5 months after surgery. Your body is getting used to the new way of eating so itâ€™s recalculating/recalibrating everything. Youâ€™ll see a weight loss very soon as long as you stick with the diet and water requirements.
18. Do not weigh yourself every week. Try to stick to weighing every 2 weeks and instead measure yourself every one or two weeks. Youâ€™ll see measurements dropping over numbers.
19. Depression tends to get a lot better a few months after surgery. However, some people go through a depressive slump directly after surgery. Make sure to keep taking your medication as prescribed by your PCP. 
20. Do not drink 30 minutes before or after eating (especially true for RNY). Drinking before will leave less room for food in your stomach. Drinking after can 'push food' through before it has time to be absorbed by the body. 
21. Dehydration, malnutrition, and vitamin deficiency are extremely common if you do not maintain control down the line. Always drink 64oz or more of water. Always take your vitamins. If you're unable to keep food down for more than 2 days, contact your doctor. 
22. For women, double up on contraception as you will become very fertile very quickly. Pregnancy needs to be avoided for up to a year after surgery.

Too much too fast?,"Hello, all! I was sleeved on 7/23 and am feeling...normal. I can gulp water, I can (but donâ€™t) eat more than a few bites of my meals, and I donâ€™t even feel like I was sleeved. I can drink a protein shake in 5 minutes (took me hours the first few days). 

Has anyone been through this? I had about 4-5 days of sipping water and not being able to take more than 2 bites. Iâ€™ve been getting all my water and protein in, but I really feel like I can eat more than Iâ€™m supposed to this far out. 

Any tips or do I just deal?"
I'm trying to decide between a Lap Band or a Gastric Sleeve. Any help?,"I'm about 95% sure that I want to get bariatric surgery, but I can't decide which one between lap band and gastric sleeve.

Does anyone else feel like 64 ounces of water is excessive for them?,"I'm not talking about that it's hard to drink that much, or annoying, even though it is. Mostly I mean that when I really dilligently work at my water goal (I track all my water in mfp and even use my kitchen scale to make sure of how much I'm putting in my yeti when it's full of ice) then I have to pee constantly and at times my pee is completely and totally clear. I'm talking like you cant even tell there's pee in the toilet. Preop I definitely did not drink this much water and my pee was always a normal weak lemonade color. I feel like I'm really overdoing it but I'm just trying to do what my doctor said. Does this happen to anyone else?"
2.5yr PO Sleeve and lost all restriction! Help!,"As title states, Iâ€™m 2.5 years post op and Iâ€™ve lost all restriction for the last 3 months. It started when I quit smoking. I quit a week pre-op and about three weeks PO, but subsequently returned to smoking again. 

Since I quit, I donâ€™t feel â€˜fullâ€™ or satisfied anymore. Iâ€™m constantly hungry and can eat just under double what I could eat before. I didnâ€™t break any rules, I didnâ€™t drink before or after eating. I still donâ€™t drink soft drink and Iâ€™m eating fairly healthy. When I did quit smoking, I did have a fair bit of popcorn and potato crisps and sunflower seeds to help with my quit for the first month but Iâ€™ve since stopped that. 

I feel like a failure every time I eat and Iâ€™m still not full or satisfied. Iâ€™m so worried that this could lead to me gaining all my weight back. Iâ€™ve gained 5kg (11 pounds) in 3 months. Help."
Did anybody keep their surgery a secret? Or did any friends/family reactive negatively?,I know I shouldnâ€™t care what people think or say but Iâ€™ve read stories about people losing friends because of envy. My friends are pretty cool but I noticed that one of my friend rolls her eyes when someone notices Iâ€™m losing weight. Iâ€™m still pre-op but on a liquid diet so Iâ€™m wondering how things will be once I get my sleeve done.
Mexico Bariatric Surgery?,"Has anyone had gastric sleeve (or any other weight loss surgery) done in Mexico? I found out today that my insurance won't cover it and I, unfortunately, do not have $20,000 to spend out of pocket. I'm trying to consider all options.

UPDATE: I'm scheduled for gastric sleeve surgery at Endobariatrics for June 29th. Thanks all for the feedback! :)"
NSV and bursting into tears,"At 334 lbs I lived a half mile from my college campus. I would walk a half mile home, collapse on my bed drenched in sweat, and have to nap. 

Today (222 lbs) I did my longest ever solo hike - 3 hours - and when I reached the top of a literal mountain and looked down at how far I had climbed  I burst into tears. Idk how to describe the feeling because itâ€™s a few things. One is that I would never have been able to see that view without surgery. It never wouldâ€™ve been part of my day. The second is.. I can move. I can hop across rocks and push myself to climb a steep ass incline into oblivion and still have enough breath to talk. I can move?!?!? I canâ€™t believe how much I couldnâ€™t move before and I didnâ€™t even know it."
Happy but sad post. My WLS claimed my relationship two weeks ago but I celebrated 4 months post op and down 65 pounds the same day.,
UPDATE: I just got screwed.,"Original post here: [I just got screwed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wls/comments/b7do4t/i_just_got_screwed/) TL;DR of that post: After completing a six month program and all requisites, then being scheduled for surgery on April 16th, the entire bariatric program I was in closed overnight on March 29th.

&amp;#x200B;

Update: Feeling pretty hopeless at this point.

After attending three support group meetings, I never got any real answers as to why the program closed. Just a lot of sad staff and shocked post-op patients. Of the 30-or-so people I met at these meetings, I was the only one who was still pre-op. Ouch. We were told, in short, that nobody on the bariatric team knows why it shut down. Profits were good, surgeries were still being scheduled regularly (I was one of 16 scheduled for April), there were no pending lawsuits, the surgeon hadn't killed anyone. Either they don't know, or they can't say. The staff, and surgeon, fought hard to try and keep the program open, or at least follow through with the scheduled surgeries, but those efforts were futile.

Since I found out about the closure, I've been put through the wringer trying to move forward. The hospital staff had lists of hospitals and clinics to reach out to, but my insurance, while good, is very localized. The insurance is a service of the hospital itself, and I have to stay in network to have any coverage at all. Not in network = zero coverage. I spoke with my HR person at work, who contacted my insurance on my behalf. I was told that literally, my only option was to get a referral to UW Madison. I contacted the office staff of the now-closed bariatric center where I was scheduled, and was told that they couldn't make the referral because it was ""specialty to specialty,"" and that I'd need to get the referral through my primary doctor. Fair enough. 

I've been seeing the same physician for 29 years, and he was the doctor who encouraged me to get surgical help to begin with. He's not in my insurance network, but after nearly three decades as his patient, I'm loathe to see anyone else. After contacting my doctor's office, and getting all my records from the bariatric clinic faxed over, I was then told that they, too, could NOT make the referral, since UW would require the referral to come from an in-network physician, which I don't have. Fuck me. 

I work long hours, so I charged my dear sister with the task of calling around to find a doctor who A, was in-network, B, was taking new patients, and C, would be willing to make a referral for a brand-new patient on the first visit. Initially, she wasn't having much luck. Doctors who were taking new patients could see me as soon as.... seven months from now. Eventually, we found and made an appointment with a doctor, whom I saw on May 2nd. Really pleasant fella. I like him. He was sympathetic to my situation and was clearly just as angry as I was about the whole fiasco. He happily made the referral for me. 

Today, over a week since that referral was made, I hadn't heard from UW Madison yet, so I called, and explained the whole situation. I was told that I wasn't the only one from the closed program that had reached out to UW, and that they've got a long list of pending surgeries at this point. I was also told that they did get the referral, and that someone from the office would be contacting me on Monday to make an appointment. And now the kick in the teeth:

I was told I'd have to start their program from the beginning.

I'm not sure I can do this. I did so well the first time around, but I was definitely faltering toward the finish line. Since completing that program, and getting the rug pulled out from under me, I fell back on old habits, I stopped logging my intake, I stopped going to the gym, and I've fallen into a pit of depression that I haven't been in since I got on medication for 4 or 5 years ago. I've gained 15 or so pounds back since my last dietician visit in March. Speaking to the rep on the phone today, half of my energy was trying to hold back rage, and the other half holding back uncontrollable sobbing.

I'm moving forward, but right now my heart just isn't in it. I want the help, I need the help, but goddamn I'm tired of getting fucked over."

RnY &amp; hernia repair - Post-op misery,"Hi all,

I'm now four days post-op from a RnY gastric bypass and a hiatus hernia repair. I stayed in hospital for three nights, with no major complications.

Not gonna lie though, I'm pretty miserable. I know it's only been a few days and hopefully looks up from here. ï¿½ï¿½


PAIN: Since surgery, I have found it painful to breathe in. Not only does it feel tight, but I get a sharp pain horizontally all around my breastbone. Of course I'm also sore around the whole area, and still dealing with gas and rumbles and some nausea.

Is the breathing issue normal? I was told it could be from the hernia repair. I'm trying to do the recommended exercises of taking 10x deep breaths and coughing once an hour, to avoid pneumonia, but it's so painful to do.


PROTEIN: I've been juuust meeting my hydration goals, but not protein. I've tried two different protein shakes and can't stomach either one! One of them was unflavoured so I was hoping to drop it into everything. The other one came highly recommended from a number of friends as tasting just like choc milk, but I almost gagged when trying it.

What if I just don't like all protein drinks? Is there anything else to use as a replacement while I'm in the liquids phase? I've had an Optifast shake today as that had an equivalent amount of protein, but I was hoping to leave Optifast behind. ï¿½ï¿½


Need some help and advice and words of encouragement please. â™¥ï¸

Many thanks."

Whatâ€™s youâ€™re cheap go to protein snacks?,"Iâ€™m trying to find high protein yet cheap -snacks/foods. For example, I bought a bulk container of dried edamame for 14 bucks on amazon! It has 14g of protein in 1/4 of a cup.

Iâ€™m not really looking for meals or recipes because I have a Pinterest board fullll of recipes. And not shakes, because, well who doesnâ€™t already know theyâ€™re high protein lol?

Any good â€œgrab and goâ€ protein ideas? "
Is it a bad idea to pre-buy smaller sizes?,"Obviously I'm not going to buy clothes just to buy clothes. I already have some stuff I absolutely have to have in smaller sizes from gaining weight, like bras, underwear and scrubs for work. But stuff like jeans and t-shirts I unfortunately got rid of. Every once in a while I find something I really like at the thrift store or on eBay and I buy it even if it's a size or two small. But then this voice in the back of my head is like, ""you're wasting money, you'll never fit into that"". I particularly got into a tough spot because the lead singer of my favorite band died and I had to buy up what shirts I could find in whatever sizes are out there because they'll be gone forever. But it's going to feel pretty bad if they never fit. What does everyone else do?"
Just got my insurance approval but had a food funeral,"Hi guys!! 

At my clinic, we have to do a six month preop program and they submit your full case to insurance and schedule your surgery at the final appointment. My final appointment was last Wednesday- Iâ€™ve lost weight every month, joined a gym, dealt with my emotional issues, and passed all my tests so they told me they thought I would absolutely be approved by insurance. 

Well!! I freaked lol. Iâ€™ve had food issues since childhood and went on a food funeral for all of my triggers (basically a carb fest) for a couple of days and gained about 7 lbs. Iâ€™m sure I donâ€™t need to explain the fear of never having my comfort foods again so Iâ€™ll move on.

Yesterday I got the call that I was approved by insurance!! Yay!! Then I saw that Iâ€™d gained 7 lbs! Ahh!!

My pre admission testing is a week from today. Obviously I cut the bullshit and Iâ€™m back on track but thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™ll lose ten lbs in a week healthily (and my period is about to start ï¿½ï¿½). I can probably lose around 4-5, though, if Iâ€™m really strict. I think a lot of it is probably water weight and bloating from all the salt. 

Do you guys think theyâ€™ll cancel my surgery if Iâ€™m up like 2-3 lbs at PAT?? I know they will if Iâ€™ve gained on surgery day, but PAT is 16 days before surgery so I will definitely be under by then. 

Thanks all, Iâ€™m just nervous!! 
"
Coffee,"RNY 1/29/2019.  My doctor is super strict and says no coffee **ever** again.  But man, thats literally the only thing I'm craving.  Did you doctor say no coffee ever? Or if you drink coffee, how soon after surgery did you start and how much coffee do you drink a day?"
Day 1 of Pre-Op Diet. I am STRUGGLING.,Iâ€™m going to preface this by saying Iâ€™m not going to cheat on my pre-op diet. Iâ€™m just really struggling. My head is killing me and Iâ€™ve been thinking about food almost constantly. Iâ€™m surprised at how mentally difficult today has already been for me. How am I supposed to go another 13 days?!
First a-hole server encounter post-op,"Had my first a-hole server encounter!! I went to brunch with an ex before I move south in a couple of weeks. We havenâ€™t seen each other since way before surgery. (That makes this worse lol)

I ordered two eggs scrambled and turkey sausage (its lasting 3 meals donâ€™t worry) and the waitress asks â€˜no toast or potatoes?â€™ I reply â€˜no thanks!â€™

SHE SAYS â€˜ohh gotcha. On a diet. Okay, sorryâ€™ and like cringes and grimaces at me. ?!?!?! 

I said â€˜no Iâ€™m not. Thatâ€™s just literally what I want to eat.â€™ She didnâ€™t really respond and just took his order. Heâ€™s thin and ordered a half sandwich. She brought him a whole one and fries. 

As soon as she walked away we were both like what the FUCK just happened!! 

It was SO WEIRD. Who does that?"
Pre-Op Liquid Diet,"I'm four days into my liquid diet. Which means I'm just over half way through my ""full liquid"" diet and haven't even started my ""clear liquid"" diet.

I've been following this group for a while and haven't seen many people post during this time. It's HARD. I'm super dedicated and I honestly thought I could ""mind over matter"" this and it wouldn't be so hard. 

Any tricks to help me feel full?

Right now I mostly am drinking protein shakes that have at least 30g of protein in them a few times a day, and supplementing that with sugar free pudding. 

Any advice at all is very much appreciated!"
"For those of you who had used food as a coping mechanizum through hard times, what have you been able to come up with since having the surgery to take the place of food?","I had my surgery about a year and a half ago.  Shortly after, I had some issues that put me back in the hospital for a month and off of work recovering for another 5 months.  At the end of this time, my wife informs me that she wants a divorce and moves out about a month later.  At first I hold my hope that things will work out and that after she is gone and away from the stress, that she would want to come back.  We visited with each other several times over the next few months until she informed me that she had been talking to someone else.  Knowing that she couldn't for another few months because she had moved out of state, I went ahead and filed for the divorce and started to work to move on in my life.  Sadly with this and the physical issues that I now have with my body due to the reason that I had to return to the hospital shortly after my surgery, I have had a lot of depression and haven't been really making any progress.  I guess in this past year since she left I have only lost about 25lbs.  
I really want to get myself refocused and back to working to lose weight but I feel that I need new ways to cope with things in my life.
Due to the divorce, I don't have much extra spending money, so can't go out and do much that has a cost to it.  I am also picking up a LOT of extra hours to help cover everything including medical bills.
What have you found to help you make it through the bad times other than food?"
Stall after only 2 weeks,"I had surgery March 27th, I was 296 and have lost 20 pounds. Last Wednesday I was cleared for stage 3 diet, which is soft protein. Since that day, I haven't lost a thing. I've been eating under 700 calories a day and getting in my protein and water requirements for the most part. Has anyone else experienced a stall this early on?"
Itâ€™s that time! Wish me luck!,

Pain and fever 2 weeks after surgery?,"Im having a low fever of 100.3 and abdominal pain under my main incision. I have a hard lump the size of half of a baseball. It was like the size of a grapefruit the day of surgery.

Ive also been draining old blood out of my main incision until 2 days ago.(dr knows about this).

Anyways is a fever of 100.3 any reason to go to the ER? Im really worried."

VSG Out-of-Pocket?,"I'm pursuing getting the sleeve done after debating it for about 10 years (yay!). I just found out my insurance won't cover surgery and the local hospital's out of pocket cost is \~$21,000. I'm researching different hospitals to see if there are cheaper options but not sure where to go. Has anyone here paid for procedure out of pocket and willing to share how much it was and where you got it? Currently, we're trying to do US based hospitals before Mexico just for continuing care, but will consider Mexico if surgery in the US is not affordable.

A Lighter Me- WLS in Mexico,"Hey all! My insurance won't cover VSG so I have been looking into travelling to Mexico and get it done. I found a company called A Lighter Me, and the package they offer includes everything- the surgery, medication, hotel stay, etc. All for under 5k. I really was set on this place until I joined the FB group.  


The FB group is run by the admin at the hospital, so it is them that are responsible for it. Now, the page has a lot of helpful information, patients sharing their pre-op and post-op stories, etc. I enjoyed reading about them. But the page has a lot of drama and it's really turning me off of the company. I wouldn't care if it were just the patients posting and acting that way, but if anyone posts anything remotely negative, it seems like the admin (people who work at the hospital) start arguing with them and it gets a little ridiculous.  


Has anyone had any experiences with alighterme? I want to go there and get the surgery but the admin behave incredibly childish. Especially a woman who is an administrative assistant there..."
IT WORKS!,"For the first week of so post-op, I really couldn't tell that I had surgery. I was still pretty hungry and never felt full. The past few days have changed almost 180, to the point where some days I've only been able to eat once. 

Last night we went to this restaurant that specializes in chicken salad. I got ONE scoop last and have already had 2 meals and about to have another one in a bit.

This is crazy!"
PSA: Smoking after RNY,"Good morning! Just wanted to stop and make a post about smoking and RNY. I know that during my pre op phase when I had all the questions, I couldn't find much info on this besides ""Don't do it"" so maybe this can help someone. 

I have smoked since I was 14 years old. I truly enjoy cigarettes. Of course I was told I had to quit before my surgeon did my RNY and I did. I went ALL out. I ended up being a successful non smoker for over a year. I got my RNY. 

One day randomly like 6 or 7 months later, for reasons unknown to me, I picked up a cigarette again and started smoking. This went on for 2 years and I'm always the girl in the group saying, ""Yeah they say don't smoke after an RNY but I do it and I'm fine..."" Until I wasn't. 2 years out- out of the blue- I got my first ulcer. Long story short I ended up back on Chantix to stop for good. Guess what feels like literally someone is stabbing you inside with a poison sword? Whatever the hell they put in Chantix dissolving into an open ulcer! Childbirth, gallstones, kidney stones- nothing comes close to this pain! 

I'm now OFF the Chantix because I have to be able to function and struggling to go cold turkey. Fun times. The moral of the story is in my TL;DR which is- LISTEN to your surgeon! You DON'T know your body better than them. If they say not to do something, don't do it. You may get away with it for awhile but it will catch up to you."
I am in the hospital after having gastric bypass this morning! Iâ€™m so excited to find this sub reddit! I canâ€™t wait to post progress pics in a couple of months! Yay!,
Pre-op liquid diet is crazy,"I have to confess my fuck up somewhere. I understand I was wrong and donâ€™t need people to tell me how horrible I am or weak. I know what I did. 

I am on day 5 of a 10 day full liquid diet. I just fucked that up completely. I had pizza and wings. I could have chosen something healthier at least, but itâ€™s too late for that as well. I can justify it all I want with how light headed I was (I was very near to actually passing out), with the fact that I have read about tons of people cheating to no ill effect, or that I was just plain starving and there had been no relief. I tried yesterday taking in more calories to see if that would help and it didnâ€™t. 

I think I need to remember that this one screw up doesnâ€™t mean I will fail. It does mean I need to talk to my counselor. I will not screw up again. Surgery is the 29th. I can make it 4 more days. 

Like I said, Iâ€™ve read enough posts on here to know there will be plenty of â€œif you canâ€™t make it preop then you shouldnâ€™t get the surgery - youâ€™re not readyâ€ but Iâ€™ve also read enough to know that we are all human and Iâ€™m hoping for a little compassion as well. Maybe some words of wisdom to get me through. I read on here frequently about people messing up post op and gaining and getting back on track. This is really no different I think. "
Warm liquid protein? Pre op,"Is there something warm that has protein in it so that I don't have to drink a cold shake? I'm on day 6 and it hasn't been bad at all, but I'm freezing."
VSG and how it helped me lose 150lbs,"TL:DR - Weighed 330, had VSG, lost 150lbs, 1.5 years later weigh 180.     

Iâ€™ve been obese for the majority of my adult life. I distinctly remember weighing 200lbs going into the 9th grade. Being fat was just being me, I knew nothing different. At age 22 and 318lbs, I decided I was going to have a difficult time finding a wife if I didnâ€™t lose the weight. I started counting calories and lost 100lbs, down to around 215. Over the next two years I married the girl of my dreams and promptly gained all of the weight back.     

Around age 27, I began considering weight loss surgery- but would never commit. To make things more difficult, each time I would begin to consider having surgery, I would start counting calories again and would manage to lose 50 or 60lbs which would convince me that I didnâ€™t need surgery at all. Unfortunately, the weight never stayed off and I always seem to gain all that I lost plus a little more.     

At age 31, three friends I knew had RNY and each ended up losing over 100lbs. I knew their personalities, their eating habits, their weaknesses. I knew if surgery could help them  keep their weight off, it could do the same for me. Five years later, they all were maintaining their weight loss.     

Two years ago, at 330lbs, I had spent the day doing yard work. I came in that evening and sat down to relax a bit and felt pain in my chest. It wasnâ€™t unbearable, but it was enough for me to be concerned. It turns out it wasnâ€™t a heart attack- just merely pulled a muscle, but the realistic thought that at age 36 I could actually be having a heart attack was enough to move me to action.     

I was going to get RNYâ€¦ after all, that was what my friends were successful with and swore by. A call to my insurance company the next day was bad news, bariatric surgery wasnâ€™t covered, I was going to have to pay out of pocket. Iâ€™m financially stable- but still, 25k for RNY is still a massive chunk of change.     

I had consults with three surgeons. 2 of the 3 strongly recommended VSG, especially for a cash pay patient. I still wasnâ€™t convinced. This is when I turned to r/wls. I read every post which ever mentioned VSG. I went back 3+ years and PMâ€™d every user who mentioned they had VSG and tried to find out what the â€œlong termâ€ success ratio was. Most all spoke very highly of it, and was extremely helpful.    

That ultimately helped me make up my mind- I was going to give VSG a shot. I knew VSG wasnâ€™t as effective as RNY, so I was hoping to get to 230. I would consider it a success at that point.     

I decided on a surgeon, and- with the cash option, got the entire procedure done for $8500 out the door. Insurance would cover the hiatal hernia portion. Obviously being a cash patient made everything much easier- I was able to go from consult to surgery in about a month.     

The entire procedure was two days. Day 1 was the scope, Day 2 was the operation. Because I was young, healthy and had no other conditions, I went home on the same day as the operation.     

I have never felt more pain than I did when I woke up from surgery. It felt like there was an ice pick buried in my sternum. I knew immediately that It wasnâ€™t the VSG procedure that hurt, it was the hernia correction. The pain was intense on recovery day, but Its manageable with meds and I was able to go home on the same day.      

Did it hurt on that day, yes. Was it worth it, absolutely. Iâ€™m extremely glad I had both procedures done as I have been successful with weight loss and reflux hasnâ€™t been an issue for me.     

Day 1 and 2, I could swallow about a tablespoon of water at a time.      

Recovery was quick, with the pain halving each day following the surgery. My operation was on a Tuesday, and I took off the following three days, but felt like I could have gone back to work on Friday If I had wanted to.      

I followed the post-op diet exactly. I did not cheat. I followed the food suggestions they laid out for me and refrained from Alcohol for 6 months.     

The weight fell off- fast. In the first year, I lost 140lbs. I work very hard to eat protein, normally eating meat first at meals. Things like Salad and bread are almost nonexistent for me.     

Portion control was always my issue, and that has been resolved. A normal meal for me now is: 1 taco, 4 chicken wings, 1 chicken thigh, 3/4 of a hotdog, 4oz Filet, 1 hamburger patty, 4 pieces of sushi etc.    

I drank Diet Coke obsessively and cut that out completely. I drink Water and Tea, but will have occasionally have a carbonated drink. I do drink alcohol on the weekends- normally a jack and coke or margarita. 3 drinks in and Iâ€™m wasted- Iâ€™m a super lightweight now.     

The only time I have really felt hungry was the first week after my surgery when I was still on a liquid diet. Since then, I basically never feel hunger. Yes, there are times I do want to eat, but itâ€™s not a true hunger. My main issue with eating now is out of boredom, snacking. I almost always avoid bread and carbs, but I do find myself grabbing a snack during the day if Iâ€™m at home for an extended period of time.     

Going into surgery my goals were 230lbs, 210 was a stretch goal and if I hit 200 I would have considered it a major success. Today, 1.5 years later I weigh 180lbs a weight I thought I would never ever see again.     

I look completely different, people look at me completely different, and honestly there are so many benefits to being a normal weight. Fitting into airplane seats, shopping for clothes, self-confidence, etc etc.     

Will I maintain this? I hope- I feel Iâ€™ve been given a second chance and Iâ€™m going to make the most of it. Does it work for everyone? No.      

A few months after my surgery a friend from work who weighed about 380 got the surgery through the same hospital I did (different surgeon, though). He only lost 80lbs and didnâ€™t have near the success I have had . On the other hand, one of my uncles had the procedure at that same hospital (he did use my surgeon) and he lost over 100lbs and got down to 210. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s the individual or the surgeon, but thereâ€™s no doubt WLS is not a magic bullet.     

r/WLS was extremely helpful during my journey and I wanted to contribute some back, so hopefully someone will find this beneficial. Let me know if you have questions- Iâ€™ll be happy to answer.     "
Is anyone Weight Training to build muscle mass?,"[https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/lyss-remaly-from-bariatric-surgery-to-bodybuilding.html](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/lyss-remaly-from-bariatric-surgery-to-bodybuilding.html)

I just read and watched this pretty cool video about Lyss Remaly.  I used to lift in the past, but I'm eight months out and I feel ready to start again.  My major issues is getting really weak when I eat the wrong food at the wrong time (this happens randomly most of the time.)  I'm staying hydrated and all my vitamin levels are good.

I went from a 30 to a 20 right now but I gotta tighten up the wiggle skin.

Any tips? Photos? Successes?

What is/was your favorite purÃ©e stage recipes?,Even interested to hear what you came up with yourself! 
Five months out and I ugly cried in front of the psychologist for the first time today,"Things are getting hard. Life is going back to normal and my problems are still problems, but I dont have food anymore. I gave up alcohol completely and I dont do drugs, so I have ... nothing. I have to actually face and cope with stresses instead of using food to stuff them down. And it's hard. I naively thought preop that losing the weight would fix a lot of things, but it fixed very little. I'm still just me. Even going to therapy for a year preop did not prepare me for what these feelings are like. And the psychologist said it's normal. He says most people go through this stage post op. My husband is too. I'm really glad I preemptively set up a mental health support team, because it would be easy to slide into alcoholism right now. Fuck this, fuck everything, fuck being an addict. Just a PSA here that this can and likely will happen to you post op and it's a kick in the teeth. 

115 down and counting..."
What is your exercise routine?,"Iâ€™ve tried everything under the sun. Nothing keeps me motivated. Iâ€™m in a huge stall right now. I have maybe lost about 10-20 lbs in a few months. Itâ€™s discouraging me and Iâ€™m not doing AT ALL what I should be. Iâ€™m eating â€œright foodsâ€ but not measuring or keeping track. I guess Iâ€™m feeling like â€œwhatâ€™s the point?â€ Because nothing seems to be working for me. Anyway, Iâ€™m trying to really step myself back into gear and create a workout/food plan and stick to it as best I can.

Failing Already...on the Pre-Op diet!,Hello everyone. I come to you absolutely ashamed of myself. Im several weeks out from RNY GB and have been absolutely failing the pre-op diet. I know I'm supposed to follow the diet to shrink my liver but I am running out of time and have little to show for it. I also worry it's an indicator that I will fail with the post op diet and not be successful after surgery. I am wondering if it is smart to put off the surgery until I can get my diet under control or to just keep doing my best (which is not great) and follow through with my surgery. I do lose my deposit if I reschedule but I figure that is better than going in to a potential situation where they can't do my surgery laparoscopically. I've got a BMI of 55 btw so I'm already quite up there. Any advice or words of wisdom? Thank you!

Hi!!

I am in the beginning stages of getting everything ready to be sleeved. Everything is looking good, I had my first Nutritionist appt, blood work and EKG done. I was SUPER pumped to get the surgery, looking at everyone here and seeing the progression has been really inspiring!

I did the mistake of telling a coworker who had the switch...

I told him I was extremely worried about getting extra skin and his reply was just like, ""We been chubby all our lives your going to need a body lift no if ands or buts."" I was all but crushed! When I had seen the others on here it didn't appear to be too bad and I tried to stay positive but I must admit I'm a little deterred. I guess my real concern is must people that I know who have had the bypass or switch look disproportion, Seriously, I mean no disrespect at all. I just do not want that at all! I am so terrified! Not only am I really not into getting surgeries and what not so this is big but i definitely do not want another surgery to correct my flab!

Did anyone else have the same concerns or Do you suffer from a lot of extra skin? Please help!!"
Anybody else feel like 30 minutes isnâ€™t long enough?,"Hi everyone!

I have been doing the whole no fluids 30 minutes before/after eating. I feel like 30 minutes after isnâ€™t long enough, like my stomach is still full and drinking just makes me uncomfortably full feeling. I usually only wait about 15 minutes before eating, the fluids are definitely â€œoutâ€ by then and Iâ€™ve had zero issues with that. 

Just curious if anyone feels like they need to wait longer than the 30 minutes to drink after eating or if itâ€™s just me.

Am I alone in this?,"I'm almost 2 years post RNY. 

I eat anything and everything I want with zero repercussions. I don't worry about calories or sugar or anything at this point. Zero hesitation with food. Spicy? Absolutely. Raw cookie dough? Fuck yeah. Energy drinks and donuts? I'm fucking down. I don't adhere to any strict diet, I don't work out more than walking more than usual. I don't do a damn thing special. I work, I sleep, I play games. That's it. That's exactly what I did previous to my surgery. 

I have lost almost 200 pounds and maintained my weight for well over a year now. I don't fluctuate weight. I don't feel like crap. I feel like a god damn super hero. I feel like I'm cheating and doing everything wrong with my surgery but I'm seeing zero side affects.

I know this post is going against everything the surgery is and what a lot of people here experience, but I can't be alone in this... Talk to me. What's going on and why is everything just working so perfectly despite everything I have ever read about post surgery life? I am not trying to gloat or brag. I am genuinely curious to see if this has any sort of common ground with post WLS people. "

young and WLS,"Hi guys,

Are you afraid for how people near you will react? How do you deal with that, i'm talking with my GP about it, but im really scared of how my parents and such will react.
Also, what are your thoughts about loose skin?"
Going it alone.,"Consider this a slightly different type of post.

Let me tell you my story. I'm an autistic woman with severe ADHD. I had RNY on October 17th of last year. Twelve days later, my spouse walked out on me, while I was experiencing some extremely un-fun post-op issues. My life basically got itself turned upside down with nowhere to turn.

Now, before you bust out the ""Oh my god, I'm so sorry that happened to you!""s and whatever, know that my life now is very good. I was offered my dream job a couple of months later, moved to a new city, and I'm down sixty pounds from my pre-surgery weight. My healthy is much improved, as well -- I'm no longer clinically depressed, woohoo! My new job has fantastic insurance, and my PCP and myriad other doctors are all part of one of the best medical systems in the country. I'm in good shape for medical success.

But with all of these good things coming my way, there's something I haven't quite figured out yet: common sense, checking myself, and when I need to make adjustments.

I have a pretty set routine. Gym five days a week before work, where I start off with 35 - 40 minutes (I've been adjusting the time upwards, little by little, so at least I've got that going for me!) on the elliptical, followed by free weights and machines depending on the day. And halfway through lifting weights, I had the extremely un-fun experience of getting to feel my left arm just sort of give up the ghost on me. No, I wasn't injured, but I was extremely concerned because, well, arms just aren't supposed to do that. (I am fine, doctor says I am fine -- don't worry, the arm did not fall off.)

It took me five days and a call to a nurse to figure out that I needed to up my calories and throw in a protein shake *before* the gym in the mornings. For whatever reason, I just hadn't considered that I might need to adjust what and when I was eating at some point. Truthfully, I haven't really adjusted what or how much I eat since Christmas, and since my doctor hasn't said anything, I really haven't paid much attention either, but it's pretty clear that was a problem.

Having added the extra calories and morning shake, the problem has been solved, but it has me wondering if anyone else has some sort of system in place that they might be able to recommend for checking themselves on things like that. When I actually had someone in my life, there was always someone asking, ""Should you be eating more?"" or ""Is that okay?"" and now that it's just me, well, I'm pretty stuck to my routines. I'd love to hear some ideas and experiences from people who might have found themselves in a similar spot."
Should I consider weight loss surgery?,"Hi all. I'm a 22 year old woman that's around 5'6"" and weighs approximately 328 lbs. I have been overweight/obese my whole life and has severe issues with overeating and have tried to lose weight on multiple occasions. I am seriously considering weight loss surgery after I rapidly gained 50 lbs in six months over the course of last year. Would getting WLS be a bad option or should I look for a natural solution? I have tried every diet to no avail and I'm scared of dying or ballooning more every single day. Thanks."
Hair loss?,Hey y'all! I'm pre-op still considering my options. I've seen some reviews about hair loss. I'm actually very concerned about that. What's been everyone's experience after a sleeve?
Anyone feel â€˜mehâ€™ about their surgery?,"I read a lot about how miserable people are before their surgeries and how wonderful life is after, Iâ€™m curious, has anyone had an experience where it wasnâ€™t life altering??

Let me back up, 27yo, female, HW 292 CW 265 in the middle of VSG pre-op process, I want this surgery because Iâ€™ve been fat my whole life and Iâ€™m tired of it hindering me from the active lifestyle I want (I went snowboarding last weekend and was sore for six days afterward, I play softball with my corporate team and want to not have to have a pinch runner bc Iâ€™m basically jogging to first), I donâ€™t hate my body in the slightest. Iâ€™m very body positive &amp; fat positive &amp; have never hated it. In fact if anything Iâ€™m nervous that Iâ€™m not going to like my skinny body!! I just wanna know f anyone has had this experience and if the surgery was less of a â€œmajor lifestyle changeâ€ and more of â€œsomething I had done for my healthâ€ without the grandiosity of rapid weight loss being the main point "
Self-Pay abroad or go thru Insurance ringer?,"I definitely qualify for WLS. 50 BMI (not that I care about BMI itself), can't remember a time in the past 7 years that it was below 45. 

I'm turning 26 in July and getting kicked off my mom's insurance. I signed up for Medicare in November with Aetna Better Health, since I don't have an actual job. I *am* going to look into how much my Cigna insurance will cost thru COBRA, but I expect it to be expensive and not ""worth"" it. Cigna only covers if you've gone thru a 6 month medically supervised plan. 

From everything I can fine, Aetna *should* cover it with a 3 month Multidisciplinary surgical prep regimen. 

But even that is still 3-4+ months away. I'm in a position where it would be fairly easy to be able self-pay up to $11k abroad somewhere (Mexico?) but I don't know if that's a ""smart"" move either. 

Thoughts? Anyone have similar decision to make?"
Surgery in 2 days...havenâ€™t followed a pre-op diet...risks?,"For context, my surgeon said it doesnâ€™t matter. Iâ€™m just concerned I will be a high-risk surgery. 

Has anyone else ever had surgery at their HW? Did things go smoothly/stay laparoscopic? 

And yes, I am aware of the concerns of whether or not Iâ€™m ready to make the lifestyle changes, however my surgeon feels it is best to not waste any time and give me the tool now rather than wait.

Concerned.,"Hi yâ€™all. I just started looking at these forums these past few days after speaking to my aunt who had WLS a little over two years ago. Iâ€™m 20 in June, weigh 291 pounds, and am 5â€™4,â€ making my BMI a whopping 50. I had looked into WLS almost two years ago right before my 18th birthday but was discouraged after asking my parents what they thought about it. However, I have decided that I have had enough. Iâ€™ve struggled with my weight since I could remember. Iâ€™ve always been a fat kid, and although I did lose a good 40 pounds when I was 15, I gained it all back (and then some) when I started having muscle and joint pains. Itâ€™s been an endless cycle since then. I am fat cause I eat too much and donâ€™t exercise but I donâ€™t exercise because I am fat and it hurts. 291 pounds is a lot of weight to put on my body, and I am constantly having back, knee, and ankle pain. I also have problems with tachycardia, im pre-diabetic (like right on the brink of it and my family history doesnâ€™t help), and i have migraines almost daily. Iâ€™ve tried sooo many diets and have lost a couple of pounds throughout the year, but always end up gaining it back. After talking to my aunt and doing some more research, I think I am ready to talk to my PCP about getting the WLS. 
How did you guys go about starting the process? I have really bad anxiety and have been let down by doctors and healthcare personnel over the years, so I am scared that I will not be taken seriously and/or be scolded by my PCP for trying to â€œtake the easy way out.â€ Iâ€™m also nervous about whether or not I would even qualify? And/or if my insurance would cover it because if it doesnâ€™t, then I cannot afford the surgery on my own. Please let me know about your journey and how your life has changed post-op. Thanks so much!! 

TLDR; Iâ€™m 19, 291 pounds, and 5â€™4.â€ After doing research, I have decided to talk to my PCP about WLS but Iâ€™m nervous about not being taken seriously. I have extreme joint pain, Iâ€™m pre-diabetic, and have migraines often. Can you guys give me some insight on your experiences? Thanks!"
Met with dietitian,8 months post op and went to dietitian for guidance for carb calorie and protein intake. She gave me 100-1200 calorie req with 25% fat 25% protein and 45% carbs. Iâ€™m suppose to manage to get 65g of protein (easy) BUT SOMEHOW 120g of CARBS??? This doesnâ€™t seem physically possible with just fruit and veg. What the actual hell 
After losing 235 pounds I finally got my surgery date! 4/18/19!,"I tried to get WLS years ago, but with a BMI of 85+ they told me there was no way I would be able to get surgery. Well, I finally did it. After losing 225 pounds in 14 months and maintaining my weight loss for the last 6 months during the preop process, I finally have insurance approval and my surgery date! My surgeon told me that I'm an ideal candidate because I am young(29), am very active, and have no comorbidities except mild hypertension which is well controlled on a low dose medication.

April 18th! I can't wait to start the next phase of my weight loss journey!

Also, no pre op diet, thank god!

Starting Weight: 605

Current Weight: 380

Pre Skin Removal Goal Weight: 205

Final Goal Weight: 185.

Hopefully in the next year or 2 I will reach my goal of 400 pounds lost. Wish me luck!

Is there a reason that you'd not lose weight after a gastric balloon?,"I've posted in here before about my brother in law, he had a gastric balloon fitted about two months ago at a peak weight of a little over 50 stone/330kg. Since then he lost a total of 16kg, all of it in the first fortnight.

Since that point he's ""maintained"". The upshot of this is that none of the family believe him when he says he's sticking to a calorie controlled diet. I calculated his BMR to be in excess of 4000 calories, and with a stomach that's 50% smaller you'd think he must be losing weight? Am I/we being unreasonable? Is there a reason other than lying that he's not losing weight?"
Changing how you see Food,"I was never like an emotional eater or used food to deal with things..I just over ate and didnâ€™t exercise or move around enough. 

I had surgery on 2/26 and so Iâ€™m a month and change out now from that date and in the last 14 ish day Iâ€™ve  come to the realization or at least this has been my experience. 

Food is no longer something you sit down to enjoy..like you donâ€™t sit down to enjoy a steak and potato dinner.  Food is now just like gasoline you put in the tank to keep you going. Sometimes itâ€™s a tough week and your broke so you put the cheap stuff in and other times youâ€™ve got some extra cash so you can put the good stuff in. 

The analogy might fall a little short but it was a hard concept for me to get till recently that food is now just fuel for activities later not something you sit back and enjoy. 

Anyone else?"
Iâ€™m scared it wonâ€™t work.,"Iâ€™m booked for the surgery and my date is August 29th. Which Iâ€™m really excited about. I started researching the possibility of getting the sleeve nearly a year ago. Itâ€™s becoming more and more real and throughout the entire process I have felt really positive about my decision. Unfortunately, doubts are starting to creep in...

Iâ€™m worried it wonâ€™t work. Okay, actually Iâ€™m worried that I will only lose like 50 lbs and then it will stop working. And I have a lot more than that to lose. I, like most obese people, have struggled to lose weight. And not for lack of trying either; Iâ€™ve tried eating at a deficit and itâ€™s incredibly difficult for me to drop weight, even when starting at a larger size. I even stopped asking for help or venting about it because people always accuse me of being dishonest about my calorie count or not logging correctly. Those kinds of experiences made me leave certain weight loss groups I was in. I find the vsg community incredibly supportive and reading everyoneâ€™s stories made me want to get the surgery. 

So while Iâ€™m in a better place about it, I still worry it wonâ€™t work. Itâ€™s a lot of money to invest and of course I want it to work. I understand that itâ€™s just a tool and that I will have to put in the effort. I know itâ€™s not an easy fix. Iâ€™m also not trying to self sabotage myself. I plan to go through with the surgery and do everything my surgeon tells me. Itâ€™s just a nagging fear really. Iâ€™m just scared Iâ€™ll go through all of it and that Iâ€™ll be one of the few that itâ€™s not successful for. 

This is mostly a vent but did anyone else feel the same way?"

Surgery is TOMORROW and I'm freaking out.,"I know I want to do this but I'm freaking out. I'm so afraid of the waking up part. I've never had a major surgery (I had two c sections) and general anesthesia freaks me out. 

What is it like when you first wake up?  Ease my mind (pls no horror stories!!)"
Fuck anyone that says WLS is the easy way out. I lost 230 pounds preop and it was WAY easier than going through the preop and postop process for WLS. This is the hardest thing I've ever done.,"Sorry, just bitching and venting a little."
When do I start freaking out?,"Had VSG 01/03/19 and already a 10 day stall. 

I been eating 100% according to my dietitians guidelines. Making sure I get my protein in and drinking water.

Will they test for cigarettes?,"I went to the seminar this week and meet with the surgeon on Monday. I was told we cannot smoke cigarettes or they will push the surgery back 3 months. Will they test me for cigarettes if I say I don't smoke? If so, how do they do that? I've switched to vaping today, does vaping count? "
Cannabis use and surgery,"So I was looking for an answer like this before my surgery in October 2018. I could not find anyone discussing their stories and/or use so heres mine. 

So I am an avid cannabis user before and after surgery. I had my sleeve done Oct 29th and was home on the 31st. I didn't want to smoke because im a cougher. So I vaped for a couple weeks. You want to avoid coughing as much as possible! As for over eating it is kind of possible but your body will stop you wether that will be alot of pain or vomiting(once you hit the wall once you will never do it again). The most important thing is water. It helps me with my water goal most days and it one of the only way I can hit my water goal without feeling sick.

21/3/2019 and Iâ€™ve lost an elephant penis... apparently lol! How about you lot?,
What was the hardest part of the surgery?,"My gastric bypass is in 3 weeks and I'm freaking out. I've seen so many people say how miserable they are after surgery and how it's the hardest thing they've ever done. For you, what was the hardest part? When did you start feeling normal again? What did it feel like when you woke up from surgery? Thank you for your input! "
RNY day! See you on the other side!,
"Back from the hospital after 3 days, feeling mixed","137kg 171cm 21yo male RNY

I hated myself so much in these last 3 days. I hated that I could not stand up on my own. I hated that I was moving like a 10.000 year old tree person, I hated the pains from gas buildup. I hated the pains while peeing and neon green liquid poop. I hated that the single sip of water hurt. I hated that my lips were so dry, and the taste in my mouth. I hated being bound to some pipes running into my body, restricting my movement. I hated that I could hardly get the second ball up in that stupid blowing exercise toy.

I still have most of these issues. Yet, being home in my comfort zone helps, and I am thinking maybe this was a good move after all. This was the hardest point in my life so far, but I am happy that I have a very supportive mother. 

Thank you for reading. If you have any tips or questions I'd love to hear. Need serious help with the green poop though, I feel like a radioactive monster."
Yep. Best decision ever.,
Hair loss and caffeine,"My current 2 pre op freak outs:

Did you lose hair? Was it noticeable? I have really thick hair that, tbh, has been my best feature for years lol

I see lots of people mention coffee - do you drink decaf or regular?"

1. I am getting a gastric sleeve surgery, not a bypass.  Why do I require in excess of 100% of the recommended daily limit?

&amp;#x200B;

2 Why the hyper-dosing? Isn't suggesting 16,667% of the daily recommended amount excessive?

&amp;#x200B;

3) These are all water soluble vitamins. Is this just a prescription for expensive urine?

&amp;#x200B;

4) So I guess I am suppose to buy a separate Calcium Citrate supplement. Even the expensive bariatric formulas do not care enough to include it, so why should I be concerned?

&amp;#x200B;

5) What does your doctor specifically recommend?  It seems this isn't settled science, so I suspect there will be a lot of variation.

Food suggestions to curb excessive snacking,"I'm 1.5 years post-vsg and -120 lbs down. Generally super happy with my wls. However, lately I feel less restriction, more hunger, and my snacking between meals is starting to get out of hand. What are some specific foods you guys like to eat that keep you fuller, longer? I need inspiration and ideas!! Scared of regaining ï¿½ï¿½

NOTE I already know about focusing on protein and how much/when to drink water. I'm looking for specific food suggestions, please."
Where do you get your â€œin betweenâ€ clothes?,"Iâ€™m getting RNY in 2/25 and want to plan ahead for my weight loss. Where do yâ€™all get your clothes to wear while youâ€™re losing weight? I donâ€™t want to hold onto my baggy clothes but I donâ€™t want to pay a ton for a new wardrobe when it wonâ€™t fit in a year. Target? Amazon? Ladies, where do you get your bras that are comfy and affordable?"
100 pounds down. Shopping for clothes still sucks ass,I finally exhausted my stockpile of smaller clothes from yoyoing and decided to go shopping today. It was just as defeating and demeaning as 100 pounds ago. And sweaty. I know realistically at a size 18 I'm still very solidly plus sized. But I just hoped it would be different. Nope...
New to Reddit. ï¿½ï¿½ Found this awesome community! 280 vs 219. VSG: 2.25.19,
6 Months Post Op. RNY August 18 HW338 SW289 CW181.,
When did you stop coffee before surgery?,
Just updating! VSG 1/24/19. WLS changed my life. Back to my old self and iâ€™ve never felt better in my life.,
Anyone else looking forward to having more sex?,TMI warning. Over the past few years Iâ€™ve noticed  a marked decline in sexual desire (not coincidentally as my weight has increased and my self esteem has decreased. Iâ€™m looking forward to liking my body again or at the very least not hating my body. Am I the only one?
Increase Depression?,"I know things are supposed to get better with weight loss, but has anyone else swung in the opposite direction?

Since surgery on Nov 5, 2018, and while I've been happy to be losing weight, I feel like my mood is getting increasingly low.

I've been depressed as long as I can remember. Counselor figures it started at age 5 when I entered school (kids are assholes) and just... never went away.

I'm not medicated - I'm the queen of side effects (and not just anti-depressants) and the two times I've tried medication, it went bad. First round turned me into a zombie that had to be shuttled back and forth to my college classes, or I just slept. How I didn't fail, I'll never know. My mood never changed, I just... slept. Second round triggered panic attacks, something I had never had before.

I feel like I'm one of the few who didn't get happier after losing weight..."
When did you tell your boss about your upcoming wls? 6 months in advance? 1 week in advance? What excuse did you give for taking so many doctorâ€™s appointments leading up to the surgery?,"Iâ€™m a little stressed about telling my boss about the surgery. Not because of anything heâ€™s said or done, but because I know there is a stigma against getting wls. People look down at you for being fat, but they also look down at you for taking the â€œeasy way outâ€ instead of â€œjust practicing some good old fashioned willpower.â€

So, Iâ€™ve been dreading telling him (or anyone), but Iâ€™ve been taking so much sick leave related to the pre-surgery classes and tests, and will continue to need to do so over the next 6 months, which will culminate in a 2-3 week absence from work for the surgery itself.

So I guess Iâ€™m wondering - should I just tell him, even at this early stage in the process (I just had my nutritionist group class)? Or do I wait and leave him wondering why Iâ€™m taking so much sick leave? How did you â€œbreak the newsâ€ to your boss?"
Annoyed!,"I went to a very expensive sushi restaurant last night where the meal is paid for at the time you make the reservation months in advance, over $300 per person + drinks, we were a party of 4. The food was amazing and definitely worth the price. This is a very upscale place and very small. Everything was top notch except for one thing. 

The meal is served in multiple course, each small and spaced out over 2 1/2 hours. I was happy that even though I had sleeve surgery 5 months ago I was able to eat 75% of the courses. When I felt like I had reached my limit I was discreetly giving my next course to one of the other 3 in my party that were more than happy to have it. Each course was very small. A piece of sushi as an example or very small dish of something. 

When the chef realized I wasnâ€™t eating my own item he asked if something was wrong and I said that everything was fantastic but I couldnâ€™t eat any more but no worries as my friends were happy to have my portion. This conversation happened twice as he asked again on a subsequent course why I wasnâ€™t eating. After the second time he refused to serve my portion anymore and would just skip me even though I made it very clear that my friends would eat my portion. No one got larger portions as a result and no credit or take home item was offered in compensation. Although I had sufficient I feel like it was my right to get served what I paid for and do what I wanted with it. The chef/owner/server all the same person was very set in his ways on many little details. Very inflexible. Am I right to be upset?

Birthday,"Today is my 30th birthday and tomorrow I have surgery! Itâ€™s such a great way to start off a new decade, hopefully greatly reducing my gastroparesis symptoms and improving my health overall. Iâ€™m on liquids, but I had a sugar free Italian ice to celebrate, and a nice tomato soup for dinner. Hereâ€™s to a new year and a new me!"
Gained weight just before surgery. VSG,"Hi everyone, so I have my surgery scheduled for January 28th, this upcoming Monday. I jumped through all the hoops and lost the 5% bossy weight needed for insurance approval. I got approved and scheduled the surgery and at my last weigh in which was about a week ago, I had gained 2 pounds. I feel like I may have gained a few more lbs and am worried that they will weigh me before the surgery and cancel it on me. What has been your experience with this? Any input is appreciated, sorry for the mobile formatting. "
200 pounds down as of today,"Nothing much to say about it, just... I did that. :)

Female, 43, obese since childhood  
5'9""  
High weight: 464  
Surgery weight: 355  
VSG on 11/20/18  
Current weight: 264  

Typical day of eating/exercise at ~6 months:

* 850-950 calories 
* 70-90g protein
* &lt;50g net carbs
* 40-50g fat (though I don't really ""control"" fat very much)
* &lt;15g sugar, no added sugars

* 30-60 min. walking, 5 times per week
* 45-60 minutes strength training, 3 times per week

No progress pics yet; I'm saving that for my 1-year surgiversary. My current goal is to get to 200, and then we'll re-assess. 

I don't really talk about these quiet victories with people around me, except with my mom and closest friends. But this is such a big milestone, it seemed worth recording it somewhere. And this seemed like an appropriate place."
Desk job- Is 1 week enough time off for RNY?,"My surgeon absolutely refuses to sign off on returning to work any sooner than 3 weeks post-op. I'm accepting a new position at work, and 3 weeks just isn't doable right now. At this point, I'm considering just taking 1 week of vacation instead of using FMLA. Is one week enough? I REALLY don't want to postpone my surgery. I'm scheduled for 7/2, and thinking about going back on the 10th. So 8 days post op..."
"The Weekly No POST-OP Question is Stupid Discussion Thread (Week of March 18, 2019)","Hey folks,

Welcome to /r/WLS! We're gonna try something new here for about a month and then re-evaluate as to whether or not it's helpful.

Without further ado....

This is the ""No Question is Stupid"" thread for all of your questions having to do with weight loss surgery from the **POST-OP** side.

We encourage folks to help out and contribute here as you would normally do with separate threads. The hope is that we can corral some similar questions together and make /r/WLS as helpful as it can be. Please be on the look-out for similar changes in the coming weeks!"
Does anyone else get flagged at TSA all the time?,"I get flagged. Every single time. And then their touchy feely stuff happens. One nice TSA lady told me that she can notice I lost a lot of weight and it's probably because of the loose skin around my stomach area, which is the area in question that gets marked. I was wondering if anyone else has the same experience."
Friend is struggling with protein,"Hey y'all, 

I'm not here for myself this time. My best friend and roommate got the VSG on Monday and is struggling to meet protein needs. The shakes are a real struggle for her. Shell take a bite or two and it's instant pain. What can we do to help her get what she needs? 

Right now, she's taking in about a half ounce/three quarter ounce at a time with about 20-30 min breaks."

Down 100 pounds for the 3rd time. Should i get surgery ?,"So i'm 35 and in the last ten years i have went from 225 pounds (I'm 6'2 so this suits me well) to 375. My problem is binge eating twice per day. Now i have gained and lost 100 pounds going on the third time. Currently at 300 now. Each time i have gained it back so as i'm going down now i am scared as hell. I think part of the reason i keep regaining is knowing that the chances of maintaining the weight loss is nearly impossible. I lose a lot of confidence in knowing this. I know it sounds weird. 

I'm thinking surgery (Sleeve Gastrectomy) is the right move. I can't gain all this wait again. It's to hard on my mental health. 

So my question is, do you think this is the right decision ? Do i sound like a good candidate ?  

Thank you."
What food are you obsessed with right now?,"Is there a food you just canâ€™t get enough of? I feel like I go through phases where all I want to eat is one type of food. I can eat it every meal and never get bored with it! 

Right now itâ€™s sauted onion and cooked spinach scrambled into an egg. Add sriracha on top and itâ€™s perfect!

Greek yogurt is my other obsession, itâ€™s so flipping delicious I crave it.

I feel like a different person because I used to get these cravings about McDonaldâ€™s or Diet Coke. Iâ€™ll take this change!"
VSG in 13 hours,"Iâ€™m nervous. My whole life is going to change. I can only hope this change is for the better. Iâ€™m more afraid of this than I was when I found out I was pregnant with my first child. Any encouraging words? Actually, they donâ€™t even have to be encouraging. Tell me exactly what Iâ€™m going to face tomorrow. Give me the real deal, no bullshit. Fear of the unknown is worse than any possible thing you guys could tell me- good or bad."
I've stopped losing. :( Is it normal 4 months post op?,"VSG Nov. 8 and my doctor put  me on Keto on Feb. 8. HW 343, SW 325, 3 mo post op 279, CW 258. I cannot get out of 258. This is becoming depressing. I've not lost anything since. Idk what to do! :((( Does this happen to everyone? "
Struggling to lose weight before surgery- should I postpone my consultation?,"Now, before anyone says I'm not prepared- I've been preparing for surgery since December of last year and I'm only now about to meet with my Surgeon on August 29th.

My issue is(obviously) I struggle to lose weight like all of us! Most people on here are put in specific pre-op diets. The nutritionist I was required to see one time gave me the worst advice. She told me to just eat bagel thins instead of bagels and stop drinking regular soda(I don't drink soda).

My problem is mostly my activity level, not my diet. I never leave the house because during the summer I become sick from the heat. and sunlight. So I'm scared i gained weight but I don't own a scale. Less than a month ago my weight was 5 pounds less than my starting weight but I'm just nervous. So I ordered a gazelle machine off Amazon so I can start working out every day at home. I have about two weeks to lose some weight. Should I reschedule the consultation again, or just go? I'm scared of insurance denying me or something. I mean, realistically what's the worst that can happen?

Edit: To those who want to give me a lengthy response about my diet: I've been counting calories for my whole damn life. It's easy to gain weight and eat more calories than you need when you don't move, I'm aware. When you need to eat 1200 calories a day to lose weight without exercise, it's easy to gain weight. No need for holier than thou attitudes. It's easy to tell someone how to do something perfectly."
"I am Pre-op and still debating whether WLS is right for me. Is there anyone out there who regrets having the surgery and if so, why? I want to be fit again but worry that this is so drastic that I may be miserable as I canâ€™t enjoy food again. Iâ€™m 250lbs &amp; wonder if fat is better than this hard road!",
Looking for some different perspectives on eating junk food,"So I'm six months out and have been going in circles with myself and I'm sick of it. I'd like some outside opinions. I have invited some junk food back into my diet and I can't decide how I feel about this. I'm still eating 90% ""clean"", I log all my calories religiously, and I never go over my calorie goal. In fact my surgeon is trying to get me to raise my calories substantially which I'm grappling with at the moment. So this is the rabbit hole I keep going down:  

""I could really go for a Butterfinger""  

""You really probably shouldnt eat candy""   

""Why not though? I have room in my calories and my macros""   

""What if it's a slippery slope and in six months you're back at 300 pounds""   

""But the psychologist wants me to practice moderation and combat perfectionism""  

""You're a food addict and always will be and you're inviting trouble""   

Etc etc etc. It's irritating. I'd like to see how other people balance this, especially over the long term."
Farting question,"Just had my surgery yesterday. Everything went great but now I'm bloated. I can burp but can't fart. How long does it take? I'm up and walking, I can lay (ish) on my left side, I'm chewing the sugar free gum, I'm drinking the warm fluids, and I can feel the gas moving but nothing is coming out. This is so uncomfortable and borderline painful. "
Did everyone else panic!?,"My surgery is on 7/30 and I start my pre-op liquid diet tomorrow morning! I feel like Iâ€™m on a roller coaster about to hit the peak (chain rattling me up higher and higher) and the big drop is inevitable! 

I want to be healthier so bad! And Iâ€™m excited for new clothes and easier mobility.

Did you all get super nervous before you had your surgery?

Iâ€™ve been mostly a lurker, but I want to thank all of you for sharing your stories and advice!"
Does anyone else regret it?,"I got the sleeve three years ago and now I ultimately wish I hadn't.

I'd rather have died young and fat than old and miserable with the idea of eating.

Two bites of anything from salad to pizza to pasta, I feel bogged down, gross, and like I just wanna barf.

Im still in pain and exhausted like I was before the surgery, just in different ways.

And now instead of giving my crap for eating too much, my family gives me crap for not eating enough. I cant win with them, and I cant win with food.

I just want to enjoy food again. I want to enjoy experiences without worrying if I'll barf.

I want to enjoy living."
What supplements are y'all taking?,"I know this is probably one of the most asked questions, I'm just wondering if anyone is taking probiotics and if that needs to be taken at some specific time of day and also I'm pretty sure I'm not taking all that I need to be taking. I just have such a hard time swallowing pills! and they feel like rocks in my tummy.  
I'm 4 weeks out started my 5th week today, I wrote a post last week about how I don't feel like eating anything and I feel a lot better after talking to you guys and not waiting 5 years in between every bite (kidding of course about the five years). I  do still struggle with knowing when enough is enough but I feel like I'm getting better at it and better at evaluating what kind of food I can't eat as much of as some other foods.  
I assume also that getting used to such small portions is a task on it's own!

Anyway I'm really glad this sub exists !"
